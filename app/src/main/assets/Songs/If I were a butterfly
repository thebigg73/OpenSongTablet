.D              D7          G                  Em
 If I were a butterfly, I'd thank You Lord for giving me wings 
.    D                                A                   A7
 And if I were a robin in a tree, I'd thank You Lord that I could sing 
.    D           D7                  G                      Em
 And if I were a fish in the sea I'd wiggle my tail and I'd giggle with glee 
.    A                A7                    D    G          D 
 But I just thank You Father for making me 'me', making me 'me'

[C]
.A       D                       D7 
 For You gave me a heart and You gave me a smile
.    G                     Em       
 You gave me Jesus and You made me Your child
.    A                A7                    D 
 And I just thank You Father for making me 'me'
.G          D      A
 Making me 'me'

[V2]
 If I were an elephant, I'd thank You Lord by raising my trunk
 And if I were a kangaroo, You know I'd hop right up to You
 And if I were an octopus, I'd thank You Lord for my fine looks
 But I just thank You Father for making me 'me', making me 'me'

[V3]
 If I were a wiggly worm, I'd thank You Lord that I could squirm
 And if I were a billy goat. I'd thank You Lord for my strong throat
 And if I were a fuzzy wuzzy bear
 I'd thank You Lord for my fuzzy wuzzy hair
 But I just thank You Father for making me 'me', making me me</lyrics>
