.Bb  Bb/A  Bb/G  Bb/F  Dsus4   D

[V1]
.        G               Bm              D
 Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall
.      G               Bm          D
 Is it time that every santa has a ball
.        C                G                 C              G
 Does he ride a red nosed reindeer, does he turn up on his sleigh
.          Am              C             D
 Will the fairies keep him sober for the day

[C]
.           G        Bm              Bb             D
 So here it is merry Christmas, everybody's havin' fun
.G           Bm               Bb   Bb/A Bb/G Bb/F  Dsus4 D
 Look to the future now, it's only just begun

[V2]
.        G               Bm        D
 Are you waiting for the family to arrive
.        G                   Bm            D
 Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside
.          C             G                 C                 G
 Does your granny always tell you that the old songs are the best
.         Am                C                D
 Then you find her rock and rolling with the rest

[B]
.Dm                   Bb
 What does your daddy do
.                   Dm            Bb              C  D
 When he finds your mamma kissin' santa claus, ah ha ha

[V3]
.        G               Bm              D
 Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall
.      G               Bm          D
 Is it time that every santa has a ball
.        C               G             C              G
 Did you ride around the hillside in a buggy you have made
.       Am             C                     D
 Do you land upon your head when you've been Slade</lyrics>
