.E           E7          A                   B7  E
 Praise Him, praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer
.E                F#m               B7
 Sing O earth His wonderful love proclaim
.E         E7        A                    B7 E
 Hail Him, hail Him, highest archangel in glory
.E        E7  A F#m  E           B7   E
 Strength and honour give to His Holy name||
.B7              F#m                  B7
 Like a shepherd Jesus will guard his children
.E              F#m                  B7  
 In His arms He carries them all day long

 O ye saints that dwell in the mountains of Zion

 Praise Him, praise him, ever in joyful song

[V2]
 Praise Him, praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer
 For our sins He suffered and bled and died
 He our Rock our hope of eternal salvation
 Hail Him, hail Him, Jesus the crucified||
 Loving Saviour meekly enduring sorrow
 Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow
 Once for us rejected despised and forsaken
 Prince of glory ever triumphant now

[V3]
 Praise Him, praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer
 Heavenly portals loud with Hosannas ring
 Jesus saviour reigneth for ever and ever
 Crown Him, crown Him, Prophet and Priest and King||
 Death is vanquished tell it with joy ye faithful
 Where is now the victory boasting grave
 Jesus lives, no longer thy portals are cheerless
 Jesus lives, The mighty and strong to save</lyrics>
