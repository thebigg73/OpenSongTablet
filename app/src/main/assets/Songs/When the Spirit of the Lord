.         Em
 When the Spirit of the Lord is within my heart
.       B7            Em         
 I will sing as David sang    x2

.       Am           Em           B7            Em
 I will sing, I will sing, I will sing as David sang
.       Am           Em           B7            Em
 I will sing, I will sing, I will sing as David sang
