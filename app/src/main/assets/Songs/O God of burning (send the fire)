.  C               F         C               G
 O God of burning, cleansing flame: send the fire!
.     C                   F      C      F        G      C
 Your blood bought gift today we claim: send the fire today!
.     G                 F       C
 Look down and see this waiting host,
.    G                 F    C
 And send the promised Holy Ghost;
.C/B Am           G    C
 We  need another Pentecost!
.F        G      C   C/B Am G F        G      C
 Send the fire today!         Send the fire today!
 
[V2]
 God of Elijah, hear our cry: send the fire!
 And make us fit to live or die: send the fire today!
 To burn up every trace of sin,
 To bring the light and glory in,
 The revolution now begin!
 Send the fire today!  Send the fire today!
 
[V3]
 It's fire we want, for fire we plead: send the fire!
 The fire will meet our every need: send the fire today!
 For strength to always do what's right,
 For grace to conquer in the fight,
 For power to walk the world in white:
 Send the fire today!  Send the fire today!
 
[V4]
 To make our weak hearts strong and brave: send the fire!
 To live, a dying world to save: send the fire today!
 Oh, see us in Your altar lay,
 We give our lives to You today,
 So crown the offering now we pray:
 Send the fire today!  Send the fire today!</lyrics>
