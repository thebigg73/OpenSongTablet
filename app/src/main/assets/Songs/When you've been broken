.F
 When you've been broken, broken to pieces,
.                         Bb                           F
 And your heart begins to faint, 'cause you don't understand.
.    F
 And when there is nothing to rake from the ashes,
.                   Bb                      F
 And you can't even walk onto the fields of praise.

[B]
.    C C/E     Bb/D              C
 But I,    bow down and kiss the Son.
.   C C/E     Bb/D              C
 Oh I,    bow down and kiss the Son.

[V2]
.F
 When the rock falls, falls upon you,
.                      Bb                      F
 And you get ground to dust, no music for your pain.
.    F
 You open the windows, the windows of heaven,
.                    Bb                            F    
 And then You opened me, and You crushed me like a rose.

[C]
.        F
 Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth,
.        C 
 Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth,
.F                                     Bb  
 Though You slay me, I will trust You, Lord.
.F                                     Bb  
 Though You slay me, I will trust You, Lord.</lyrics>
