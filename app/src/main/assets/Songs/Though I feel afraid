.G                       Em     D    C
 Though I feel afraid of territory unknown,
.  A7              G          D             G
 I know that I can say that I do not stand alone.
.    G                             Em       D     C
 For Jesus, You have promised your presence in my heart;
.  A7/C#          G/D              D                G
 I cannot see the ending, but it's here that I must start.

[C]
.D7  G             C   G/B  D7     G
 And all I know is you have called me,
.    C           G/B       Am7       Dsus4   D
 And that I will follow is all I can say.
.G               C   G/B  D7   G
 I will go where You will send me,
.    C         D7        G
 And Your fire lights my way.
     
[V2]
 What lies across the waves may cause my heart to fear;
 Will I survive the day, must I leave what's known and dear ?
 A ship that's in the harbour is still and safe from harm,
 But it was not built to be there, it was made for wind and storm.

;LAST TIME    
.       C            D7           Em7  Em7/D
;And Your fire lights my way,
.       C            D7           Em7  Em7/D
;And Your fire lights my way, 
.       C            D7           G  
;And Your fire lights my way.</lyrics>
