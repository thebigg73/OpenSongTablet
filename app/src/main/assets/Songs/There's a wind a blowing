.C
 There's a wind a blowing all across this land
.
 Fragrant breeze of heaven, blowing once again
.F
 Don't know where it comes from, don't know where it goes
.                     C        
 But let it blow over me
.G         F                        C
 Oh, sweet wind, come and blow over me

[V2]
 There's a rain a pouring, showers from above
 Mercy drops are coming, mercy drops of love
 Turn your face to heaven, let the waters pour
 Well let it pour over me
 Oh, sweet rain, come and pour over me

[V3]
 There's a fire burning, falling from the sky
 Awesome tongues of fire, consuming you and me
 Can you feel it burning? Burn the sacrifice
 Well let it burn over me
 Oh, sweet fire, come and burn over me</lyrics>
