  <lyrics>[V1]
.   Em                    D         Em
 In Heavenly armour we'll enter the land
.    C        D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord
.   Em                       D              Em
 No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand
.    C        D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord

[C]
.    C  D    G  D   C D G 
 And we sing Glory, Honour
.C         D               Em
 Power and strength to the Lord      x2

[V2]
 When the powers of darkness come in like a flood
 The battle belongs to the Lord
 He's raised up a standard the power of His blood
 The battle belongs to the Lord

[V3]
 When the enemy presses in hard do not fear
 The battle belongs to the Lord
 Take courage my friend your redemption is near
 The battle belongs to the Lord</lyrics>
