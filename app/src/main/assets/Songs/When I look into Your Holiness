  <lyrics>[V1]
.       C                  Dm7
 When I look into Your Holiness  
.       C                    Dm7
 When I gaze into Your loveliness
.         C         
 When all things that surround 
.       F                       Dm  G 
 Become shadows in the light of You

[V2]
.          C                              Dm7
 When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart
.        C                              Dm7
 When my will becomes enthroned in Your love
.         C          
 When all things that surround 
.       F                       Dm   G 
 Become shadows in the light of You

[C]
.          F  G           Em  Am
 I worship You, I worship You
.    Dm7          G              C   C7
 The reason I live is to worship You
.          F  G           Em  Am
 I worship You, I worship You
.    Dm7          G              C   F   C   G
 The reason I live is to worship You</lyrics>
