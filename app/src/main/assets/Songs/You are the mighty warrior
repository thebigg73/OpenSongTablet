.E9
 You are the mighty Warrior!    
 (You are the mighty Warrior!)
.C#m
 Through You, we know we'll overcome
 (Through You, we know we'll overcome)  
.F#m
 By the power of Your Spirit
 (By the power of Your Spirit)
.B
 We'll claim the victory in this land

[V1]
.G#m                    C#m
 We fight the powers of darkness
.G#m               C#m
 Our war is in the air
.G#m                C#m
 Sent by our mighty Saviour
.A              B
 We declare our war

[V2]
 Nothing can ever harm us
 Now death has lost its sting
 By Your death and resurrection
 The victory is ours

[V3]
 Take His Word to this nation
 A house of prayer for this land
 See the powers of evil crumble
 Right across this land</lyrics>
