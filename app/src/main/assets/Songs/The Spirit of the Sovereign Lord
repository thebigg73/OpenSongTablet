[V2]
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us, 
 Because He has anointed us to preach good news.
 The Spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us,
 Because He has anointed us to preach good news.||
 He will comfort all who mourn,|(This is the year)
 He will provide for those who grieve;|(This is the day)
 He will pour out the oil of gladness,|(This is the year)
 Instead of mourning you will praise.</lyrics>
