 He is the Lord, and He reigns on high;

 He is the Lord.

 He is the Lord.

 Who is like unto Him, never ending in days;
.D         G
 He is the Lord.
.    G                         C           G
 And He comes in power when we call on His name.

 He is the Lord.

[V2]
 Your gospel, O Lord, is the hope for our nation;
 You are the Lord.
 It's the power of God for our salvation.
 You are the Lord.
 We ask not for riches, but look to the cross;
 You are the Lord.
 And for our inheritance give us the lost.
 You are the Lord.

[C2]
 Send Your power, O Lord, our God.
 Send Your power, O Lord, our God.
 Our God.</lyrics>
