[V2]
 Good Christian men rejoice with heart and soul and voice!
 Now hear ye of endless bliss:
 Jesus Christ was born for this.
 He hath opened the heavenly door, and man is blest for evermore
 Christ was born for this, Christ was born for this.

[V3]
 Good Christian men rejoice with heart and soul and voice!
 Now ye need not fear the grave:
 Jesus Christ was born to save;
 Calls you one and calls you all, to gain His everlasting hall:
 Christ was born to save, Christ was born to save.
