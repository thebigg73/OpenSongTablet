.     G           D
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
.     Em     C2
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing;
.     G           D
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
.     Em     C2
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.

[V1]
.              G/B                   C2
 Your love is amazing, steady, and unchanging,
.               D                         C2
 Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet;
.               G/B                     C2
 Your love is a mystery, how You gently lift me,
.             D                          C2
 When I am surrounded, Your love carries me.

[V2]
.                G/B                    C2
 Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising,
.                   D                      C2
 All the joy that's growing deep inside of me;
.             G/B                        C2
 Every time I see You, all Your goodness shines through,
.                    D                      C2
 And I can feel this God song, rising up in me.</lyrics>
