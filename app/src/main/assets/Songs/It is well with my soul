  <lyrics>[V1]
.     C                    F          C         Am           D           G
 When peace like a river attendeth my way,|When sorrows like sea billows roll;
.    C       F              D            G           C           F    G    C
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,|“It is well, it is well with my soul.”

[C]
.      C            G
 It is well, (it is well,)
.        G              C
 With my soul, (with my soul,)
.      F           C    G       C
 It is well, it is well with my soul.

[V2]
.       C                           F             C         Am           D          G
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,|Let this blest assurance control,
.     C            F         D         G               C            F     G      C
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,|And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

[V3]
.   C                         F        C           Am          D            G
 My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought!|My sin, not in part but the whole
.   C             F            D          G                C                F     G    C
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,|Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

[V4]
.     C                           F              C          Am               D         G
 And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,|The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
.    C             F              D            G           C         F    G       C
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,|Even so, it is well with my soul.</lyrics></song>
