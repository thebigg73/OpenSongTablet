 Christ the blessed one gives to all, wonderful words of life
 Sinner list to the loving call, wonderful words of life
 All so freely given, wooing us to Heaven
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, wonderful words of life
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, wonderful words of life

 Sweetly echo the gospel call, wonderful words of life
 Offer pardon and peace for all, wonderful words of life
 Jesus only saviour, sanctify for ever
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, wonderful words of life
 Beautiful words, wonderful words, wonderful words of life</lyrics>
