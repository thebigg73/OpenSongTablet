.A                     D/A
 These are the days of Elijah, 
.   A          E           A
 Declaring the word of the Lord:
.    A                          D/A
 And these are the days of Your servant Moses,
.A/E           E        A
 Righteousness being restored.||
.    C#m                            F#m
 And though these are days of great trial,
.   Bm7        Bm7/A        E
 Of famine and darkness and sword,
.      A                       D
 Still we are the voice in the desert crying
.    A/E         E          A
 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord.'

[C]
.          A                   D/A
 Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
.                 A                  E   
 Shining like the sun at the trumpet call;
.          A                      D/A
 Lift your voice it's the year of jubilee,
.              A       E      A
 Out of Zion's hill salvation comes.

[V2]
 These are the days of Ezekiel,
 The dry bones becoming as flesh;
 And these are the days of Your servant David,
 Rebuilding the temple of praise.||
 These are the days of the harvest,
 The fields are as white in the world,
 And we are the labourers in the vineyard,
 Declaring the word of the Lord.</lyrics>
