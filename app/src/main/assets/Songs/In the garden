  <lyrics>[V1].  G                                   C                   G I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses;.        D                    G              A7            D And the voice I hear falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses.[C].       G                     D And He walks with me, and He talks with me,.       C        D7       G And He tells me I am His own;.        G      B7          Em    C And the joy we share as we tarry there,.     G         D7   G None other has ever known.[V2].   G                                        C                          G He speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;.        D              G               A7             D And the melody that He gave to me, Within my heart is ringing.[V3].    G                                       C                  G I'd stay in the garden with Him, Though the night around me be falling;.       D                    G                 A7             D But He bids me go; thru the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.</lyrics></song>
