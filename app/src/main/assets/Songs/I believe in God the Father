.G                    C2 
 I believe in God the Father,
.G                      D      
 I believe in Jesus the Son:
.G                         C2     G/B  Am7   
 I believe in God the Holy Spirit,
.  D                       C2 
 I believe in the Three in One  x2

[V1]
.G                          C2 
 I believe He was born of a virgin,
.    G                           D
 Was crucified and buried in the ground.
.  G                             C2 
 Descended into hell and won the battle,
.        Am7                   C                 Dsus4   D
 But the devil, death and hell couldn't hold Him down

[B]
.  Cmaj7                     Em7
 O Lord we're drowning in confusion,
.   C                         Em7
 So many of us going separate ways;
.Bm7                        Am7
 Wanting to be God is our delusion,
.    C                        
 But some of us are standing up,
.               Dsus4 D           G 
 Not ashamed to say, I believe, I believe !

[V2]
 I believe He ascended into heaven,
 Where He sits at God's right hand;
 And I believe our King will be returning
 To judge the living and the dead, from every tribe and land.</lyrics>
