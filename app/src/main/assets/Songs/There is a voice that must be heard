.A    D/A   E/A   D/A   x2

[V1]
.A                     Asus4        
 There is a voice that must be heard
.A                    Asus4        
 There is a song that must be sung
.A                    Asus4             G    E
 There is a name that must be lifted high
.A                   Asus4        
 There is a treasure more than gold
.A               Asus4        
 There is a King upon the throne
.A                  Asus4                G     E
 There is One whose praise will fill the skies

[C]
.            A E/A D/A        A E/A  D/A
 His name is Jesus, friend of sinners
.       A E/A D/A        F#m  E   D   (as intro to repeat)
 Jesus, Jesus, friend of mine

[V2]
 There is a peace that calms our fears
 There is love stronger than death
 There is a hope that goes beyond the grave
 There is a friend that won't let go
 There is a heart that beats for You
 There is one name by which we are saved

[B]
.Bm         E             Bm
 When I was captive to my fears
.            E               Bm    E
 You are the One who came to me
.          F#m   E  D     F#m  E   D
 You set me free</lyrics>
