.Dm    Bb/D   Dm   Bb/D    

[V]
.F                               
 Over the mountains and the sea, 
.Gm7
 Your river runs with love for me,
.Bb                    Csus4
 And I will open up my heart,
.                          F
 And let the healer set me free.
.F
 I'm happy to be in the truth, 
.Gm7
 And I will daily lift my hands,
.Bb                        Csus4
 For I will always sing of when Your love came down, yeah!

[C]
.F                    Gm7
 I could sing of Your love forever,
.Bb                   Csus4
 I could sing of Your love forever.    x2

[B]
.Gm7             F/A      Bb                 Csus4
 Oh, I feel like dancing, it's foolishness I know;
.Gm7                    F/A
 But when the world has seen the light,
.          Bb                        Csus4
 They will dance with joy like we're dancing now
