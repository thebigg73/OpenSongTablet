  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                                       F    C
 Whose lips will plead for the people of this land ?
.       F            C/E            Am7          G
 Who'll stand in the gap and who'll build up the wall ?
.  C                                      F C
 Before the long day of God's patience is over,
.  F              C              G              C
 Before the night comes when His judgement will fall.

[V2]
 And whose eyes will weep for the dry eyes of this land ?
 And whose heart will break for the hearts made of stone ?
 For those who are walking out in the darkness,
 Away from God's love, without Christ so alone.

[V3]
 And whose ears can hear what the Spirit is saying ?
 For those who are willing to watch and to pray.
 Pray on 'till God's light fills the skies over this land.
 The light of revival that brings a new day.
