.E              C#m7        A2                       Bsus E
 What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
.E                C#m7         A2                       Bsus E
 What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[C]
.E           C#m7
 Oh precious is the flow,
.Bsus
 That makes me white as snow;
.E        C#m7
 No other fount I know,
.A2                       Bsus E
 Nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[V2]
.E             C#m7        A2                       Bsus E
 For my pardon this I see, nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
.E                C#m7          A2                       Bsus E
 For my cleansing this my plea, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.

[V3]
.E              C#m7            A2                       Bsus E
 This is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Je___sus;
.E              C#m7           A2                       Bsus E
 This is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Je___sus.</lyrics></song>
