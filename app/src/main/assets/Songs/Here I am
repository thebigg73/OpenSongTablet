.E2                                                             A
 Here I am, and I have come to thank You, Lord, for all You've done;
.           E2
 Thank You, Lord.
.    E2                                                         A 
 You paid the price at Calvary, You shed Your blood, You set me free;
.           E2
 Thank You, Lord.
.   B7sus4           E2             B7sus4           A        E2   (B2) 
 No greater love was ever shown, no better life ever was laid down.

[C]
.    E2                      A
 And I will always love Your name;
.    B7sus4                  E2     (B first time only)
 And I will always sing Your praise.  x2

[V2]
 You took my sin, You took my shame, 
 You drank my cup, You bore my pain;
 Thank You, Lord.
 You broke the curse, You broke the chains, 
 In victory from death You rose again;
 Thank You, Lord.
 And not by works, but by Your grace 
 You clothe me now in Your righteousness.

[V3]
 You bid me come, You make me whole, 
 You give me peace, You restore my soul;
 Thank You, Lord.
 You fill my cup and when I'm full 
 You give me more 'till I overflow;
 Thank You, Lord.
 You're making me to be like You, 
 To do the works of the Father too.</lyrics>
