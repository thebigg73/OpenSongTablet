.C            Am       Em          Am7
 Meekness and majesty, manhood and deity
.C          Am           D7         G
 In perfect harmony, the Man who is God
.C       C7/Bb    F         F#dim7
 Lord of eternity dwells in humanity
.Em/G          Am       F F/E  F/D C
 Kneels in humility and washes our feet

[C]
.Dm       G        E7           Am        F
 O what a mystery, meekness and majesty
.F#dim7       C/G     Am     Dm
 Bow down and worship 
.    G            Bb    Bb    F      
 For this is Your God
.G            Ab   Gm7   C    (G)
 This is your God

[V2]
 Father's pure radiance, perfect in innocence 
 Yet learns obedience to death on a cross
 Suffering to give us life, conquering through sacrifice    
 And as they crucify, prays "Father forgive"

[V3]
 Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible
 Love indestructable, in frailty appears
 Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly 
 Lifts our humanity, to the heights of His throne</lyrics>
