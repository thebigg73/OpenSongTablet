 Jesus promised life to all, walk, walk in the light.
 The dead were wakened by his call, walk, walk in the light

 To save the lost like you and me, walk, walk in the light.

 We know his death was not the end,  walk, walk in the light.
 He gave His Spirit to be our friend, walk, walk in the light.

 By Jesus' love our wounds are healed,  walk, walk in the light.
 The Father's kindness is revealed,  walk, walk in the light.

[V6]
 The Spirit lives in you and me,  walk, walk in the light.
 His light will shine for all to see,  walk, walk in the light.</lyrics>
