.G D      Em         C               D
 I have a destiny, I know I shall fulfill 
.G D      Em               C         D
 I have a destiny, in that city on a hill
.D D/C    G       D        D/C    G
 I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish
.      Em         D        C           D  G
 For I know I was born for such a time as this

[V1]
.Bm                          C
 Long before the ages You predestined me
.   Bm                                C
 To walk in all the works You have prepared for me
.       F                          Bb
 You've given me a part to play in history
.   A                         D
 To help prepare a bride for eternity

[V2]
.Bm                                C
 I did not chose You, but You have chosen me
.      Bm                            C
 And appointed me for bearing fruit abundantly
.       F                            Bb
 I know You will complete the work begun in me
.       A                            D
 By the power of Your Spirit working mightily</lyrics>
