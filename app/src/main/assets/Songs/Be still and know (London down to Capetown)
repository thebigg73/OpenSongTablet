.A     D  E  x3     A     E ....

[V1]
.             A  D E          A  D E
 Be still and know, that I am God;
.          A    D        E                  A  D E
 I will be glorified and praised in all the earth.
.             A  D E          A    D E
 For My great name  I will be found,
.          D           A/C#   Bm7        A   Bm7 A/C#
 And I can never be resisted, never be undone;
.    D             A/C#     Bm7        A   Bm7 A/C#
 I'm never lacking power to glorify My Son
.    D                 E               A         E/G#   F#m  F#m/E
 The gates of hell are falling and the church is coming forth
.   D              E            A    D E     A  E....
 My name will be exalted in the earth.

[V2]
 Be still and know that I am God;
 I have poured out My Holy Spirit like a flood.
 The land that cries for holy rain
 Shall be inheriting her promises and dancing like a child,
 A holy monsoon deluge shall bless the barren heights,
 And those who sat in silence shall speak up and shall be heard;
 My name will be exalted in the earth.

[V3]
 Be still and know, that I am God;
 My Son has asked me for the nations of the world
 His sprinkled blood has made a way
 For all the multitudes of India and Africa to come;
 The Middle East will find its peace through Jesus Christ My Son.
 From London down to Cape Town, from L.A. to Beijing,
 My Son shall reign the undisputed King!</lyrics>
