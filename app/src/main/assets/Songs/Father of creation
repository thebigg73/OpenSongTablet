 ____Father of creation, unfold Your sovereign plan.

 Raise up a chosen generation

 That will march through the land.

 Oh God, let this be the hour.

 Let it go forth from here to the nations.

 Let Your fragrance rest in this place,

 As we gather to seek Your face.

[V2]
 Ruler of the nations, the world has yet to see
 The full release of Your promise,
 The church in victory.
 Turn to us, Lord, and touch us, make us strong in Your might.
 Overcome our weakness,
 That we could stand up and fight.

 The glory of Your Son
