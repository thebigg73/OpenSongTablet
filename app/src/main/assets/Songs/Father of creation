.G/B C     D   D/F# G    C           D   D/F#  G
 ____Father of creation, unfold Your sovereign plan.
.C          D           Em   Bm/D
 Raise up a chosen generation
.Am7             Am/G         D   G/B
 That will march through the land.
.C          D   D/F# G        C          D      D/F# G 
 All of creation is  longing, for Your unveiling of  power
.C           D           Em       Bm/D
 Would You release Your anointing,
.Am7         Am/G        D   
 Oh God, let this be the hour.

[C]
.         G     D/F#         C/E   G/D
 Let Your glory fall in this room,
.          C          G/B         Dsus4   D
 Let it go forth from here to the nations.
.         G         D/F#         C/E   G/D
 Let Your fragrance rest in this place,
.      Am7       Dsus4 D   G      (G/B)
 As we gather to seek Your face.

[V2]
 Ruler of the nations, the world has yet to see
 The full release of Your promise,
 The church in victory.
 Turn to us, Lord, and touch us, make us strong in Your might.
 Overcome our weakness,
 That we could stand up and fight.

[B]
.F        C       G                  C/E F
 Let Your kingdom come|(Let Your kingdom come)
.F        C       G                  C/E F
 Let Your will be done|(Let Your will be done)
.F      C      G                C/E F
 Let us see on earth|(Let us see on earth)
.F         C       Dsus4  D
 The glory of Your Son
