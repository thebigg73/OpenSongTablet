  <lyrics>.A     D           A                  A7       D
 Wide, wide as the ocean, high as the heavens above
.E                 A              B7           E
 Deep, deep as the deepest sea is my Saviour's love
.A  D           A                  A7           D
 I, though so unworthy, still am a child of His care
.D            E          A             F#m        Bm  E  A    (E)
 For His word teaches me that His love reaches me everywhere</lyrics>
