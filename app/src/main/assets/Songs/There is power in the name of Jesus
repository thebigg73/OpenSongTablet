 There is power in the name of Jesus;

 We believe in His name.
.        C             F       C       
 We have called on the name of Jesus;
.       D    F         G
 We are saved!  We are saved!||
.       Am Em           F  G
 At His name the demons flee.
.       Am Em             F    G
 At His name captives are freed.
.          F           G            Am  D
 For there is no other name that is higher

[V2]
 There is power in the name of Jesus,
 Like a sword in our hands.
 We declare in the name of Jesus,
 We shall stand!   We shall stand!||
 At His name God's enemies
 Shall be crushed beneath our feet.
 For there is no other name that is higher
 Than Jesus!
