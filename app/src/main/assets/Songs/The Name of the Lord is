.                E      A         E
 The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
.                  B7                   E  A  E  B7
 The righteous run into it and they are saved.

 The name of the Lord is a strong tower,
.                  B7                   E  A  E  B7
 The righteous run into it and they are saved.
