  <lyrics>[V1]
.G              D            Em
 We want to see Jesus lifted high,
.              C     C/B Am D   G
 A banner that flies across the sky;
.G                  D                 Em
 That all men might see the truth and know,
.          C  C/B Am  D
 He is the way to heaven.

[C1]
.G               D               Em             C C/B Am D   G
 We want to see, we want to see,|We want to see Jesus lifted high!
.G               D               Em             C C/B Am D   G
 We want to see, we want to see,|We want to see Jesus lifted high!

[V2]
.G       D                 Em
 Step by step we're moving forward,
.          D                   Em
 Little by little we're taking ground;
.      D                    Em
 Every prayer is a powerful weapon,
.            Am   Am/G     D
 Strongholds come tumbling down,
.    D/C      D/B      D/A
 And down and down and down...

[C2]
.G                D                Em              C C/B Am D   G
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see,|We're gonna see Jesus lifted high!
.G                D                Em              C C/B Am D   G
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see,|We're gonna see Jesus lifted high!
