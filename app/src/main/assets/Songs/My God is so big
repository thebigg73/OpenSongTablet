 My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
.        F#m        B7         E  A  E   
 There's nothing my God cannot do
.B7 E     
 My God is so big, so strong and so mighty

 There's nothing my God cannot do

 The rivers are His, the mountains are His

 The stars are His handiwork too

 In all that you say and you do
 My God is so big so strong and so mighty
 There's nothing my God cannot do
