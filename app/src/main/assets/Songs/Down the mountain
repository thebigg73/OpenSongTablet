.G drone with whistle     C   C/B  C/A  G

[V1]
.C        G/B          D/A D/B G
 Down the mountain the River   flows
.G/A G/B C        G/B        D/A D/B D G
 And it  brings refreshing wherever it goes
.C           G/B         D/A  D/B G
 Through the valleys and over the fields
.G/A G/B C        G/B          D/A D/B D G
 The     River is rushing, the River  is here

[C]
.    G        G   G/A  G/B C      G
 The River of God sets our feet a dancing
.    G        G   G/A  G/B  D/A    D    G
 The River of God fills our hearts with cheer
.    G        G   G/A  G/B  C           G/B
 The River of God fills our mouths with laughter
.    C    G/B           D/A D/B D  G
 And we rejoice for the River   is here

[V2]
 The River of God is teeming with life
 And all who touch it can be revived
 And those who linger on this River's shore
 Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord

[V3]
 To the mountain we love to go
 To find the presence of the Lord
 Along the banks of the River we run
 We dance with laughter, giving praise to the Son</lyrics>
