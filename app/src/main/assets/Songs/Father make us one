.Ab      Db      Eb
 Father, make us one,
.Ab      Db      Eb
 Father, make us one,
.         Db        Eb
 That the world may know

 Thou hast sent the Son,

 Behold how pleasant and how good it is
 For brethren to dwell in unity,
 For there the Lord commands the blessing,
 Life forever more.</lyrics>
