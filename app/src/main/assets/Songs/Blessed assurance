.(G)       C        F        C 
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
.         Am           D7      G
 O what a foretaste of glory divine
.G7         C       F           C
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God
.            F  Dm   G             C    G 
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

[C]
.           C      F          C
 This is my story, this is my song
.            D        D7          G   G7 
 Praising my Saviour, all the day long
.           C      F          C
 This is my story, this is my song
.            F Dm     G           C   G
 Praising my Saviour, all the day long

[V2]
 Perfect submission, perfect delight
 Visions of rapture burst on my sight
 Angels descending, bring from above
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

[V3]
 Perfect submission, all is at rest
 I in my Saviour am happy and blest
 Watching and waiting, looking above
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love</lyrics>
