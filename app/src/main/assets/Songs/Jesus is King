  <lyrics>[V1]
.F        Am       Bb       F
 Jesus is King and I will extol Him
.Bb           F         G          C
 Give Him the glory and honour His name
.F            Am      Bb             F
 He reigns on high, enthroned in the heavens
.Gm          F        Gm C       F  (C)
 Word of the Father, exalted for us

[V2]
 We have a hope that is steadfast and certain
 Gone through the curtain and touching the throne
 We have a Priest who is there interceding
 Pouring His grace on our lives day by day                  

[V3]
 We come to Him, our Priest and Apostle
 Clothed in His glory and bearing His name
 Laying our lives with gladness before Him
 Filled with His Spirit we worship the King

[V4]
 O holy One, our hearts do adore You
 Thrilled with Your goodness we give You our praise
 Angels in light with worship surround Him
 Jesus, our Saviour, for ever the same</lyrics>
