;As first two lines of verse

[V1]
.Em                        Bm7
 This is the mystery,|That Christ has chosen you and me,
.   C                        G/D  D   D/B   
 To be the revelation|Of His glo__ry.
.Em                    Bm7
 A chosen, royal, holy people|Set apart and loved,
.  C        Am7            Dsus4   D
 A bride preparing for her King.
 
[C]    
.        G         D             Am7       Em
 Let the Bride say come,|Let the Bride say come,
.        G            D        C    Bm7  Am7 D
 Let the Bride of the Lamb|Say come Lord Jesus.
.        G         D             Am7       Em
 Let the Bride say come,|Let the Bride say come,
.        G            D        C         D      G     D/B
 Let the Bride of the Lamb|Say come Lord Jesus, come.

[V2]
 She's crowned in splendour|And a royal diadem,
 The King is enthralled|By her beauty.
 Adorned in righteousness,|Arrayed in glorious light,       
 The Bride in waiting for her King.

[V3]
 Now hear the Bridegroom call,|"Beloved come aside,
 The time of betrothal|Is at hand.
 Lift up your eyes and see|The dawning of the day,
 When as King, I'll return to claim my bride."</lyrics>
