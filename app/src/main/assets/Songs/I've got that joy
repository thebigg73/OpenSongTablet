.              A
 I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy
.                  E
 Down in my heart, down in my heart
.          A
 Where ?   Down in my heart
.     E        A
 I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy
.                  Bm         E7       A  A7
 Down in my heart, down in my heart to stay

[C]        
.           D              A
 And I'm so happy, so very happy
.     E                           A    A7
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart
.           D              A
 And I'm so happy, so very happy
.     E                           A  D  A  E
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart

[V2]
 I've got that peace that passes understanding
 Down in my heart, down in my heart
 Where ?   Down in my heart
 I've got that peace that passes understanding
 Down in my heart, down in my heart to stay</lyrics>
