  <lyrics>[V1]
.F      Bb       F       C        Dm  A7 Bb        F C   G7   C
 Love divine all loves excelling, joy of heaven to earth come down
.F      Bb     F      C         Dm  C   F   Bb   F  C    F
 Fix in us Thy humble dwelling, all Thy faithful mercies crown 
.F A7  Dm       Bb  C    F      F              Dm   G7   C 
 Jesus Thou art all compassion, pure unbounded love Thou art 
.Bb    F       C      F C     F     Bb F  C         F 
 Visit us with Thy salvation, enter every trembling heart 

[V2]
 Breathe O breathe Thy loving Spirit into every trembling breast
 Let us all in thee inherit, let us find thy promised rest
 Take away the love of sinning, Alpha and Omega be
 End of faith as it's beginning, set our hearts at liberty

[V3]
 Come Almighty to deliver, let us all Thy grace receive
 Suddenly return and never, never more Thy temples leave
 Thee we would be always blessing, serve Thee as Thy hosts above
 Pray and praise Thee without ceasing, glory in Thy perfect love

[V4]
 Finish then Thy new creation, pure and spotless let us be
 Let us see our whole salvation, perfectly restored in Thee
 Changed from glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place
 Till we cast our crowns before Thee, lost in wonder, love, and praise</lyrics>
