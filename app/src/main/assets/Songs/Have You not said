.C                       G                  C                G 
 Have you not said as we pass though water,|You will be with us?
.C                         G                 Am7            G  
 And you have said when we walk though fire,|We will not be burned.||
.C                      G
 We are not afraid, for You are with us;
.Am                     G
 We will testify|to the honour of Your name.
.C                 Em7               Am7         Am7/G       D/F#
 We are witnesses,|You have shown us|You are the One who can save 
 
[C]
.G                                 C             G
 Fill us up and send us out in the power of Your name
.G                                 C     D       G
 Fill us up and send us out in the power of Your name

[V2]
 Bring them from the west, sons and daughters,|Call them for Your praise.
 Gather from the east all Your children,|Coming home again.||
 Bring them from afar, all the nations,
 From the north and south,|drawing all the peoples in.
 Corners of the earth,|come to see there's|only one Saviour and King
