  <lyrics>[V]
.     Bb                     Eb/G      Bb
1I'd  rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
2I'd  rather have Jesus than men's ap__plause;
3He's fairer than lilies of  rarest    bloom;
.     Bb             Bb/D          F/C    Bb   F
1I'd  rather be      His than have riches un___told;
2I'd  rather be faithful to        His    dear cause;
3He's sweeter than honey from      out    the  comb;
.     Bb                     Eb/G       Bb
1I'd  rather have Jesus than houses or  lands.
2I'd  rather have Jesus than world-wide fame.
3He's all that my hungering  spirit     needs.
.    Bb            Bb/E        Bb/G F       Bb
1I'd rather be     led by His  nail-pierced hand.
2I'd rather be     true to His ho___ly      name.
3I'd rather have Jesus and     let  Him     lead.

.        F/C    F         Gm     Bb
 Than to be the king of a vast domain
.       F/C     F           Eb/Bb Bb
 And be held in sin's dread sway__.
.    Bb                     Eb/Bb Bb
 I'd rather have Jesus than any___thing
.     Bb/F    F       Eb/Bb Bb
 This world affords today.___</lyrics>
