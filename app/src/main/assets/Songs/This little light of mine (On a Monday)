.G                          G7
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
.C                                           G
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
.G                          B7               Em
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
.C     G          C          G       D    C
 Ev'ry day, ev'ry day, ev'ry day in ev'ry way.
.          G      D            G    
 I'm gonna let my little light shine

[C]
.     G
 On a Monday, He gave me the gift of love
.     C
 On a Tuesday, His peace came down from above
.     G
 On a Wednesday, He told me just what to say
.     D
 On a Thursday, He told me just how to pray||
.     G
 On a Friday, He gave me a little more faith    
.     C
 On a Saturday, He gave me a lot more grace
.     G                      B7    Em
 On a Sunday, He gave me the power divine
.   G        D            G
 To let my little light shine</lyrics>
