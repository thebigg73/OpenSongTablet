  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                 G        D     D            G         D     A
 When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory died,
.D                 G         D     D           A        G      D
 My richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my pride.

[V2]
.D                      G          D     D          G         D       A
 See from His head, His hands, His feet, sorrow and love flow mingled down:
.D                      G      D     D            A       G      D
 Did e’er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?

[C]
.       G         D             G         D
 Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross,
.        G                D               A
 Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live;
.       G         D             G         D
 Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross,
.        G              D                   A
 All who gather here by grace draw near and bless Your name.

[V3]
.D                       G      D     D            G        D       A
 Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were an offering far too small;
.D                G    D     D          A        G        D
 Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all!</lyrics>
