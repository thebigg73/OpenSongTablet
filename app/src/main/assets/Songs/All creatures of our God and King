  <lyrics>[V1]
 All creatures of our God and King,
 Lift up your voice and with us sing:
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 Thou burning sun with golden beam,
 Thou silver moon with softer gleam:

[C]
 O praise Him, O praise Him,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

[V2]
 Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
 Ye clouds that sail in heaven along,
 O praise Him, hallelujah!
 Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,
 Ye lights of evening, find a voice:

[V3]
 Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
 Make music for thy Lord to hear,
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 Thou fire so masterful and bright,
 That givest man both warmth and light:

[V4]
 And all ye men of tender heart,
 Forgiving others, take your part,
 O sing ye, hallelujah!
 Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
 Praise God and on Him cast your care:

[V5]
 Let all things their Creator bless,
 And worship Him in humbleness,
 O praise Him, hallelujah!
 Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
 And praise the Spirit, Three-in-One:</lyrics>
