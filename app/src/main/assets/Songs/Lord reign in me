  <lyrics>[V1]
 Over all the earth
 You reign on high
 Every mountain stream
 Every sunset sky
 But my one request
 Lord my only aim
 Is that you’d reign in me again

[C]
 Lord reign in me
 Reign in your power
 Over all my dreams
 In my darkest hour
 You are the Lord of all I am
 So won’t you reign in me again

[V2]
 Over every thought
 Over every word
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
 Cause You mean more to me
 Than any earthly thing
 So won’t you reign in me again
</lyrics></song>
