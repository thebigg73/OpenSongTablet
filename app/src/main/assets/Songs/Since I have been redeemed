.  D             A       D                         A
 I have a song I love to sing, since I have been redeemed;
.   D            A       D           G      A      D
 Of my Redeemer, Savior, King, since I have been redeemed.

.      D             A             G                     
 Since I have been redeemed, since I have been redeemed 
.       D     A      D
 I will glory in His name;
.      D             A              G           A        D
 Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior’s name.

 I have a Christ Who satisfies, since I have been redeemed;
.   D              A       D            G      A      D
 To do His will my highest prize, since I have been redeemed.

[V3]
.  D              A          D                          A
 I have a witness bright and clear, since I have been redeemed;
.   D             A         D           G      A      D
 Dispelling every doubt and fear, since I have been redeemed.

[V4]
.  D              A         D                       A
 I have a home prepared for me, since I have been redeemed;
.      D              A     D         G      A      D
 Where I shall dwell eternally, since I have been redeemed.</lyrics></song>
