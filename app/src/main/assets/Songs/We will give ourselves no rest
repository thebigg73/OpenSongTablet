[V]
.E                             B A
 We will give ourselves no rest
.                                  B  F#m7
 'Till Your kingdom comes on earth;
.                                  E
 You've positioned watchmen on the walls.
.E                                    B A
 Now our prayers will flow like tears,
.                                     B  F#m7
 For You've shared your heart with us;
.                               E
 God of heaven, on our knees we fall.

[B]
.     A       B      A/C#               B 
 Come down in power, reveal Your heart again;
.     A        B          A/C#                 B
 Come hear our cries, the tears that plead for rain.

[C]
.      E
 We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven,
.      C#m7
 We're crying, crying for this generation,
.      F#m7                             A              B 
 We're praying for Your name to be known in all of the earth.||
.      E
 We're watching, watching on the walls to see You,
.      C#m7
 We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough,
.      F#m7
 We're praying for Your word to bear fruit
.A             B                    E     (or INTRO)
 In all of the earth, in all of the earth.</lyrics>
