.        C        B7       C
 O happy day that fixed my choice
.           Dm      G      C   G
 On thee my Saviour and my God
.              C       B7      C
 Well may this glowing heart rejoice
.              Dm       G    C    C7
 And tell it's raptures all abroad

[C]
.        F            C
 O happy day, O happy day
.           Dm        G     C  C7
 When Jesus washed my sins away
.             F                C
 He taught me how to watch and pray
.           D             G         G7
 And live rejoicing every day, Hallelujah
.        C      B7    C
 O happy day, O happy day
.           Dm        G     C    G
 When Jesus washed my sins away

[V2]
 Tis done, the great transaction's done
 I am my Lord's and He is mine
 He drew me and I followed on
 Charmed to confess the voice divine

[V3]
 Now rest my long divided heart
 Fixed on this blissful centre, rest
 O who with earth, would grudge to part
 When called with angels to be blest

[V4]
 High heaven that heard, the solemn vow
 That vow renewed shall daily hear
 Till in life's latest hour I bow
 And bless in death a bond so dear</lyrics>
