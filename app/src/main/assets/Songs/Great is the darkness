.G            C             G          D
 Great is the darkness that covers the earth
.G            C           D      C
 Oppression injustice and pain
.G           C           G        D  
 Nations are slipping in hopeless despair
.       G         C            D      G/B
 Though many have come in Your name
.C              G      D G/B 
 Watching while sanity dies, 
.C              G           C   D
 Touched by the madness and lies 

[C]
.G         C G    D         C G
 Come Lord Jesus, come Lord Jesus 
.G             C         D      C
 Pour out Your Spirit we pray
.G         C G    D         C G
 Come Lord Jesus, come Lord Jesus
.G             C         D    G   (D)  (E to verse 3)
 Pour out Your Spirit on us today

[V2]
 May now Your church rise with power and love
 This glorious gospel proclaim
 In every nation salvation will come
 To those who believe in Your name
 Help us bring light to this world, 
 That we might speed Your return

;KEY CHANGE TO A

[V3]
 Great celebrations on that final day
 When out of the heavens You come
 Darkness will vanish, all sorrow will end
 Rulers will bow at Your throne
 Our great commission complete 
 Then face to face we shall meet</lyrics>
