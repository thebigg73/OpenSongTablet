.A         A/C#        D                 D/C#
 Wake up O sleeper and rise from the dead

 And Christ will shine on you
.A         A/C#        D                 D/C#
 Wake up O sleeper and rise from the dead

 Once you were darkness, but now you are light

 Now you are light in the Lord

 So as Your children of light we must live

 Showing the glory of God
.E   E/D E/C# E/B
 Wake up sleeper!

[V2]
 This is the beautiful fruit of the light
 The good, the righteous, the true
 Let us discover what pleases the Lord
 In everything that we do
 Wake up sleeper!

[V3]
 As days get darker, take care how you live
 Not as unwise, but as wise
 Making the most of each moment He gives
 And pressing on for the prize
 Wake up sleeper!</lyrics>
