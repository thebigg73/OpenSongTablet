.        A    D/A      A             E    D       A 
 Far and near hear the call, worship Him, Lord of all; 
.    A       D/A     A         E          D       A  
 Families of nations come, celebrate what God has done.

.         A    D/A    A           E    D     A 
 Deep and wide is the love heaven sent from above; 
.          A       D/A     A          E         D   A 
 God's own Son for sinners died, rose again, He is alive

 Let the earth rejoice for the Lord reigns.

[V3]

 At His name let praise begin, oceans roar, nature sing.

 For He comes to judge the earth in righteousness and in His truth.</lyrics>
