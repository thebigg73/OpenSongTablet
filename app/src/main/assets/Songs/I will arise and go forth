 I will arise and go forth in the name of the Lord of hosts
.           E               B7         E            B7
 For He has conquered every foe by His name, by His name
.         E               B7          E E7     A    F#m
 I will declare He is the Lord and in Him I am not afraid
.       E             B7          E  A  E  B7
 I will arise and go forth in His name</lyrics>
