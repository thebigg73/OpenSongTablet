.E           B7                                  E 
 Mister Noah built an ark,|The people thought it such a lark
.E           B7                                E
 Mister Noah pleaded so,|But into the ark they would not go

[C]          
.E                     B7 
 Down came the rain in torrents|(Splish Splash) 
.                      E
 Down came the rain in torrents|(Splish Splash) 
.E             E7      A    F#m     E    B7         E A E B7
 Down came the rain in torrents and only eight were saved

[V2]
.    E               B7                                E
 The animals went in two by two, elephant, giraffe and kangaroo
.E               B7                             E  
 All were safely stowed away, on that great and awful day

[V3]
.    E              B7                          E
 Whenever you see a rainbow, whenever you see a rainbow
.E           E7    A  F#m     E      B7     E  A  E  
 Whenever you see a rainbow, remember God is love</lyrics>
