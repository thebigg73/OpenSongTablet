  <lyrics>[V1]
.E              B                      F#m                B
 When the music fades,|all is stripped away,|and I simply come;
.E               B                         F#m                         B
 Longing just to bring|something that's of worth,|that will bless Your heart.||
.F#m            E/G#        B                     F#m
 I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself,
.            E/G#       B     A/B  B
 Is not what You have required
.F#m             E/G#       B                            F#m
 You search much deeper within, through the way things appear,
.               E/G#    B
 You're looking into my heart.

[C]
.E                      B2/D#
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship,
.         F#m                 A         B      E
 And it's all about You; it's all about You, Jesus;
.E                       B2/D#
 I'm sorry, Lord for the thing I've made it
.          F#m                 A         B      E   B F#m Bsus B E
 When it's all about You; it's all about You, Jesus.

[V2]
 King of endless worth,|no-one could express,|how much You deserve;
 Though I'm weak and poor,|all I have is Yours,|every single breath.||
 I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself,
 Is not what You have required
 You search much deeper within, through the way things appear,
 You're looking into my heart.

[B]
.E                          B2/D#             F#m   A  B
 I'll bring You more than a song, more than a song
.E                          B2/D#             F#m   A  B
 I'll bring You more than a song, more than a song
.E                          B2/D#             F#m   A  B
 You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart
.E                          B2/D#             F#m   A  B
 You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart
