.      E                  B                  A                B        E
1 My   hope is built on   nothing less than  Jesus' blood and righteousness;
2 When darkness veils His lovely face, I     rest on His un___changing grace.
3 His  oath, His cove_____nant, His blood|support me in the   whelming flood;
4 When He shall come with trumpet sound, O   may I then in    Him be   found;
.         E                  B                   A                B        E
1 I       dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on   Jesus'   name.
2 In      every high and     stormy gale, my     anchor holds within the   veil.
3 When    all around my      soul gives way, He  then is all my   hope and stay.
4 Dressed in His righteous___ness alone, fault___less to stand be_fore the throne.

.   E                 A
 On Christ, the solid rock I stand;
.    E                       B
 All other ground is sinking sand,
.    A               B       E
 All other ground is sinking sand.</lyrics></song>
