.E/A   B   E/A   B    E/A   B   E/A   B

[V1]
.    Esus4             E
 One thing my heart is set upon, 
.    Esus4              E
 One thing that I would ask:
.   Esus4              E
 To know you, Lord, as close as one 
.      Esus4           E
 Could hope to on this earth.

[C]
.E/A   B            E/A  B
 Intimacy, O Jesus, Intimacy.
.   E/A           B                 E/A   B
 My treasure will be, O Jesus, Your intimacy.

[V2]
 To look upon Your beauty, Lord,
 Your glory and Your heart;
 To know You close and closer still
 Each day upon this earth

[V3]
 Lord, since the day I saw You first,
 My soul was satisfied;
 And yet because I see in part,
 I'm searching more to find.</lyrics>
