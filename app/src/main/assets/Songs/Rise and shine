1The Lord said to Noah, there's gonna be a floody, floody
2The Lord told Noah to build him an arky, arky
3The animals, the animals they came on by twosies, twosies
4It rained and poured for forty daysies, daysies
5The sun came out and dried up the landy, landy
6Well this is the beginning of, the beginning of my story, story

1Get those children out of the muddy, muddy, children of the Lord
2Build it out of gopher barky, barky, children of the Lord
3Elephants and kangaroosies, 'roosies, children of the Lord
4Almost drove those animals crazies, crazies, children of the Lord
5Everything was fine and dandy, dandy, children of the Lord
6Everything is hunky-dorey, dorey, children of the Lord</lyrics>
