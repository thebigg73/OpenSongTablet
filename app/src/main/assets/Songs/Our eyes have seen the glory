.    G          
 Our eyes have seen the glory of our Saviour Christ the Lord
.      C                              G
 He is seated at His Father's side in love and full accord
.                                     B7            Em
 From there upon the sons of men, His Spirit is out poured
.    Am    D       G    D
 All hail ascended King

[C]
.G                        C                 G
 Glory, glory hallelujah, glory, glory hallelujah
.G                 B7  Em     Am   D        G  (D)
 Glory, glory hallelujah, all hail ascended King

[V2]
 He came to earth at Christmas and was made a man like us
 He taught, He healed, He suffered and they nailed Him to a cross
 He rose again on Easter Day, our Lord victorious
 All hail ascended King

[V3]
 The good news of His Kingdom must be preached to every shore
 The news of peace and pardon and the end of strife and war
 The secret of His Kingdom is to serve Him evermore
 All hail ascended King

[V4]
 His Kingdom is a family of men of every race
 They live their lives in harmony enabled by His grace
 They follow His example 'till they see Him face to face
 All hail ascended King</lyrics>
