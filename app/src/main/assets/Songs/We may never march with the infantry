.E
 We may never march with the infantry
.B7                     E
 Ride with the cavalry, shoot with the artillery 
.E
 We may never Zoom on the enemy
.      F#m          B7     E     A   E   B7
 Cause we're in the Lord's army (Yes Sir!)

[C]
.E                         A   E   B7
 We're in the Lord's army (Yes Sir!)
.E                         A   E   B7
 We're in the Lord's army (Yes Sir!)

.E
 We may never fly like Superman
.B7                    E
 Climb like Spiderman, bend like Bananaman
.E
 Indiana Jones, he ain't the kind of guy I am
.      F#m        B7     E     A   E   B7
 Cause I'm in the Lord's army (Yes Sir!)</lyrics>
