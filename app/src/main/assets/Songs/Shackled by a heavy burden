.D    A    D    Dsus4     D

[V1]
.A                   D
 Shackled by a heavy burden
.A                            D    D/C
 'Neath the load of guilt and shame
.G                      D
 Then the hand of Jesus touched me
.    Em          A7         D   Dsus4  D
 And now I am no longer the same

[C]
.   A                   D         D/C
 He touched me, Yes, He touched me
.    G       D        Bm        Em  A
 And oh, the joy that floods my soul
.D         A7/E         D/F#  G
 Something happened and now I know
.   D              Bm   A  D   Dsus4  D
 He touched me and made me whole

[V2]
 Since I met this blessed Saviour
 Since He cleansed and made me whole
 I will never cease to praise Him
 I'll shout it while eternity rolls</lyrics>
