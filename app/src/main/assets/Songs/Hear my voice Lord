.Em                       A
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You
.Em                       A
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You

 Who could stand if sins were known, and recorded

[V2]
.Em                       A
 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You

 Hear my voice Lord, as I cry to You, for mercy
