.F                 Dm
 Go tell it on the mountain
.Gm       Bb/C      F
 Over the hills and everywhere
.F                 Dm
 Go tell it on the mountain
.     G9    Gm7       F
 That Jesus Christ is born

[V]
.      F                    Dm7
1While shepherds kept their watching
2The   shepherds feared and trembled
3Down  in a lowly           manger
.     Gm                F
1O'er silent flocks by  night
2When lo above the      earth
3The  humble Christ was born
.     F                   Dm7
1Be___hold throughout the heavens
2Rang out the angel       chorus
3And  God sent us sal_____vation
.      G          F           C7
1There shone a    holy li_____ght
2That  hailed our Savior's birth
3That  blessed    Christmas morn</lyrics>
