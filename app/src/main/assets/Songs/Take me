.G    D    Em   C
.G    D    Em   C    G    .....

[C]
.G    D   Em              C
 Take me, Lord, I give my life to you,
.G    D       Em            C
 Take me, and I'll become a child before You,
.G    D   Em             C
 Take me, burn a passion deep within my heart,
.G    D   Em          C               G   .........
 Take me, let me be a channel of Your love.

[V1]
.D         Em              G             D
 Into Your river, let your water flow on me,
.D            Em               G              D
 Lord, I will follow, from the shallow to the deep.
.Bm        Em                     C               D
 I don't belong Lord, where I can stand on my two feet,
.Bm        Em                     C            D
 I want to swim Lord, where I can never be too deep!

[V2]
 Called out of darkness, let Your light fall down on me;
 To shine before all men, I've the light of Christ in me.
 I cannot stand, Lord, on my own strength, I am too weak,
 I should be standing with the Rock beneath my feet.</lyrics>
