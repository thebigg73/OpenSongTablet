  <lyrics>[V1]
.D            G             A7       Dsus4 D
 Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
.G           D/F#      E       E7   A
 There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
.A7            D                         G
 Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not;
.G#dim7       D             A7        D
 As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.

[C]
.A        G   D        D7/C  B7           Em
 Great is Thy faithfulness!  Great is Thy faithfulness!
.A7         D           E7        A
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;
.A7         D          D7           G
 All I have needed Thy hand hath provided,
.G#dim7       D             A7        D
 Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!

[V2]
 Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest
 Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
 Join with all nature in manifold witness
 To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love

[V3]
 Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
 Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
 Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
 Blessing all mine, with ten thousand beside!</lyrics>
