.E    A/F#    E/G#   B    x2

[V]
.E      B/F#        A        B/F#
 He was pierced for our transgressions
.A      E           F#m F#m/A  B
 He was crushed for our iniquities 
.E      B/F#        A        B/F#
 He was pierced for our transgressions
.A      E           F#m F#m/A  B 
 He was crushed for our iniquities
.        G#              C#m/E                F#m   F#m/A    E
 And the punishment that brought us peace was fully borne by Him
.    A             E/G#          F#m F#m/A  B
 And by His wounds we are healed,    we are healed

[C]
.       E    B7/F#     A       E
 We are healed, we are healed
.            A          A/G#  F#m   F#m/E  B 
 Through the blood that Jesus shed, we are healed
.        E                E7/F#
 And the curse of sin and death and hell 
.    E7/G#            A
 Has all been laid on Him
.E/G#   F#m     E/G#         F#/A
 By His wounds, nail pierced wounds
.E/G#   A       B      E     A/F#  E/G#  B   B/A
 By His wounds, we are healed
