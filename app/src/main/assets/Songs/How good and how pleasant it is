.    G    Em7     Am7
 How good and how pleasant it is
.C/D         D7      C  G  C/D
 When we all live in unity
.  G  Em7      Am7
 Refreshing as dew at the dawn
.     C/D            D7           G    C  D
 Like rare anointing oil upon the head

[C]
.        G
 It's so good (It's so good)
.   Em7
 So good (So good)
.Am7                      C/D            D7
 When we live together in peace and harmony
.        G
 It's so good (It's so good)
.   Em7
 So good (So good)
.Am7            D             C    C/D
 When we live together in His love

[V2]
 How deep are the rivers that run
 When we are one in Jesus
 And share with the Father and Son
 The blessings of His everlasting life</lyrics>
