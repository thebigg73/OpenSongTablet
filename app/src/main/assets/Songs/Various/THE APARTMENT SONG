.A
 I used to live in a two-room apartment
.                   E     A
 Neighbors knockin' on my wall
 Times were hard I don't wanna knock it
.                E       A
 I don't miss it much at all

;CHORUS
[C
.D   A    E     A    D       A             E
  Oh yeah I'm alright I just feel a little lonely tonight
.D      A  E            A  D       A             E        A
  I'm okay most of the time I just feel a little lonely tonight
[

 I used to need your love so badly
 Then I came to live with it
 Lately I get a faraway feeling
 And the whole thing starts again

 (CHORUS and 2nd verse)</lyrics>
