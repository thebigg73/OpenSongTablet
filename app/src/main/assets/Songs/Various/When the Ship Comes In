.G                     D11         C           G
 Oh the time will come up when the winds will stop
.        Em          C             G
 And the breeze will cease to be a-breathin
.         G                D11             C           G
 Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
.      G           D          G
 The hour that the ship comes in
.        D11       C            G
 And the sea will split and the ships will hit
.        D11           C                G
 And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
.       D11                       C          G
 And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
.        G      C    C/B   D/A  G
 And the morning will be a-breaking

 Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
 And the seagulls will be a-smilin'
 And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
 The hour that the ship comes in
 And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
 Will not be understood as they're spoken
 Oh the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
 And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

 A song will lift as the main sail shifts
 And the boat drifts unto the shoreline
 And the sun will respect every face on the deck
 The hour that the ship comes in
 And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
 For your wearied toes to be a-touchin'
 And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
 That the whole wide world is watchin'

 Oh the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
 And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
 But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
 And they'll know that it's for real,
 The hour that the ship comes in
 And they'll raise their hands
 Sayin' we'll meet all you demands
 But we'll shout from the bow
 Your days are numbered
 And like Pharoah's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
 And like Goliath they'll be conquered</lyrics>
