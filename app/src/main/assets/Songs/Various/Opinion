 Congratulations, you have won
. A#5             B        C#5    F#5
 It's a useless discretion of that kind
.A#5                 B    C#5      F#5
 If it makes your story, I'm concerned
.A#5        B       C#5      F#5
 You set it up, your glory burns

.   A#5    B    C#5 F#5    A#5    B   C#5 F#5
 My opinions... hmmmm... My opinion... mhmmm
.   A#5    B   C#5  F#5     A#5   B   C#5 F#5
 My opinions... hmmmm... My opinion... mhmmm

.    A#5        B     C#5     F#5
 There seems to be a problem here
.     A#5                  B         C#5        F#5
 When you scared them all off, it seemed real clear
. A#5           B        C#5    F#5
 Now the risen follower watches tough
.    A#5          B           C#5     F#5
 And they haven't plauged the hope he saw

.      A#5     B  C#5 F#5      A#5     B  C#5  F#5
 I got opinions... hmmmm... My opinions... mhmmm
.    A#5    B  C#5  F#5     A#5    B   C#5  F#5
 My opinions... hmmmm... My opinions... hmmmm

. A#5         B   C#5       F#5
 Congradulations, you have won
. A#5             B        C#5    F#5
 It's a useless discretion of that kind
.A#5                 B    C#5      F#5
 If it makes your story, I'm concerned
.A#5        B       C#5      F#5
 You set it up, your glory burns
.     A#5    B   C#5  F#5       A#5   B   C#5 F#5
 Your opinions... hmmmm... Your opinion... hmmmm
.     A#5    B   C#5  F#5       A#5   B   C#5 F#5
 Your opinions... hmmmm... Your opinion... mhmmm
