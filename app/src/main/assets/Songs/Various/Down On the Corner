;Creedence Clearwater Revival

;Intro:
 | Riff 1      | Riff 1     | Riff 2      | Riff 1    |
;(riffs 1 and 2 continue through verses along with rhythm guitar)

;Verse 1:
.C                       G                C
 Early in the evenin'   just about supper time,  over by the courthouse,
.        G              C    F                         C
 they're starting to unwind, four kids on the corner,  trying to bring you up,
.                              G               C
 Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp.

;Chorus:
.F           C        G          C                      F            C
 Down on the corner,  out in the street,  Willy and the Poorboys are playin'
.          G               C
 bring a nickel,  tap your feet.

;Verse 2:
.C                               G                 C
 Rooster hits the washboard, and people just gotta smile,  Blinky thumps the
.             G         C        F                              C
 gut bass and solos for awhile.  Poor-boy twangs the rhythm out on his
.                                             G              C
 Kalamazoo.  And Willy goes in to a dance and doubles on Kazoo.

;Repeat chorus

;3rd verse:
.C                       G              C
 You don't need a penny just to hang around,  but if you got a nickel won't
.     G             C      F                   C
 you lay your money down.  Over on the corner, there's a happy noise,
.                                G              C
 people come from all around to watch the magic boy.

;Repeat chorus and fade:</lyrics>
