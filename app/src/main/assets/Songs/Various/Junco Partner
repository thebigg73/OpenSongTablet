.N.C.     F
 Down the road came a Junco Partner
.           Bb             F
 For he was loaded  as can be
.F
 He was knocked out, knocked out loaded
.         C7                    F
 He was a'wobblin' all over the street
.F
 Singing 6 months ain't no sentence
.    Bb                F
 And one year ain't no time
.F
 I was born in Angola
.        C7    F
 Serving 14 to 99

 Well I wish I had me  $1 million dollars
 Oh one million to call my own
 I would raise me ?????
 Raise me ??????

 Well I wish I would have me a great deal of money
 Yeah and mighty good things all over town
 Now I ain't got no more money
 All of my good friends are putting me down

 Now I ain't got no more money
 I'm gonna pawn my watch and chain
 I would have pawned my seat Gabriella
 But the smart girl wouldn't sign her name

....

 Give me headstone when I die</lyrics>
