.      A         D                    E          A    D A
 Oh Sis-ters of Mer-cy they are not de-par-ted or gone
.      C#m             G#m           C#m          G#m         E Esus4 E
 They were wait-ing for me when I thought that I just cant go on
.      D                     A          G          F#m              E Esus4 E
 And they brought me their com-fort and later they brought me their song
.   A           D                        E           A    D
 Oh I hope you into them you who've been trav-ling so long

.G/D D/A A7 D    G/D D/A A7 D        A       E
                                             
 Yes you who must leave everything
 That you cannot control
 It begins with your family,
 but soon it comes round to your soul
 Well I've been where you're hanging
 I think I can see how you're pinned
 When you're not feeling holy
 Your loneliness says that your've sinned

 They lay down beside me
 I made my confession to them
 They touched both my eyes
 And I touched the dew on their hem
 If your life is a leaf
 That the seasons tear off and condemn
 They will bind yoou with love
 That is graceful and green as a stem

 When I left they were sleeping
 I hope you run into them soon
 Dont turn on the lights
 You can read their address by the moon
 And you wont make me jealous
 If I hear that they sweetened your night

.D   E
     
.          A            D
 We werent lov-ers like that
.       A                 E          A
 And besides it would still be all right

 We werent lovers like that
 And besides it would still be all right</lyrics>
