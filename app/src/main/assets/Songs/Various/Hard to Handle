;As Performed by the Black Crowes
.B
 Baby here I am I'm a man on the scene
 I can give you what you want but you got to come with me
 I've got some good old lovin' and I got some more in store
 When I get through throwin it on you you got to come back for more
.F#
 Boys have things that come by the dozen
.F#
 that ain't nothing but drugstore lovin'
.B
 Pretty little thing let me light your candle 'cause mama I'm sure hot to handle now yes around

.B
 Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man of great experience
 I know you got another man but I can love you better than him
 Take my hand don't be afraid I'm gonna prove every word I say
 I'm advertisin' love for free so you can place your ad with me
.F#
 Boys that come along a dime by the dozen
.F#
 that ain't nothin but ten cent lovin'
.B
 Pretty little thing let me light your candle 'cause mama im sure hot to handle now yes around

.A    E    B       A    E    B  A  B       A    E    B       A    E    B
                                                                       

.B
 Baby here I am the man on your scene
 I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
 I've got some good old lovin' and I got some more in store
 When I get through throwin' it on you you got to come back for more
.F#
 Boys'll run along a dime by the dozen
.F#
 that ain't nothing but drugstore lovin'

 Pretty little thing let me light your candle 'cause mama im sure hot to handle now yes around
