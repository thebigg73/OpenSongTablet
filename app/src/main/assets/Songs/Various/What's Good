.D                      G   Em
 Life's like mayonnaise soda
.D                    Em       G
 And life's like space without room
.D                         G   Em
 And life's like bacon and ice cream
.D                       Em      G
 That's what life's like without you

 Life's like forever becoming but
 Life's forever dealing in hurt
 Now life's like death without livin'
 That's what life's like without you

 Life's like sanskrit to a pony
 I see you in my mind's eye stranglin' on your tongue
 What good is knowin' such devotion
 I been around, huh, I know what makes things run

 What good is seeing eye chocolate
 What good's  a computerized nose
 And what good is cancer in April
 Why no good, no good at all

 What good's a war without killing
 What good is a rain that falls up
 What good's a disease that won't hurt ya
 Why no good, no good at all

 What good are these thoughts that I'm thinkin'
 They must be better, huh, not to be thinkin' at all
 A styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete
 No, not much at all

 What good is life without livin'
 What good is a lion that barks
 You've loved a life others throw away nightly
 It's not fair at all

 What's good
 Oh, baby what's good
 What's good
 What's good, not much at all

 Hey baby what's good
 What's good
 What's good, what's good
 What's good, what's good, not much at all

 What's good, what's good
 What's good, life's good
 Life's good, life's good
 But not fair at all</lyrics>
