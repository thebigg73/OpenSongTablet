. A
 All the old paintings on the tombs
.                   G                A
 They do the sand dance don't you know
. A
 If they move too quick (oh whey oh)
.                       G         A
 They're falling down like a domino

 All the bazaar men by the Nile
 They got the money on a bet
 Gold crocodiles (oh whey oh)
 They snap their teeth on your cigarette

. D
 Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
 Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
. A
 Walk like an Egyptian

 The blonde waitresses take their trays
 They spin around and they cross the floor
 They've got the moves (oh whey oh)
 You drop your drink then they bring you more

 All the school kids so sick of books
 They like the punk and the metal band
 When the buzzer rings (oh whey oh)
 They're walking like an Egyptian

 All the kids in the marketplace say
 Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
 Walk like an Egyptian

 Slide your feet up the street bend your back
 Shift your arm then you pull it back
 Life is hard you know (oh whey oh)
 So strike a pose on a Cadillac

 If you want to find all the cops
 They're hanging out in the donut shop
 They sing and dance (oh whey oh)
 Spin the clubs cruise down the block

 All the Japanese with their yen
 The party boys call the Kremlin
 And the Chinese know (oh whey oh)
 They walk the line like Egyptian

 All the cops in the doughnut shop say
 Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh
 Walk like an Egyptian
 Walk like an Egyptian</lyrics>
