.   B                     E                    B
 1. He's got a slow slow ride, got a camera inside
. A                   C#m            B
 He takes a picture, hangs it up to dry
.                      E                      B
 And there's one girl named, and another displayed
. A                C#m                  B
 All the time you can't help feeling ashamed
.  A         C#m          E
 Given new reasons to survive
. A           C#m           F#m B
 He keeps a number of them alive
.           E              G#m
 There's a warning in the sky
.     E              G#m
 A stranger passing by
.             E                   G#        C#
 And there's more than meets the eye to the guy.

 2. When you're so secure, never feeling unsure
 That's the time to check behind your door
 Cause there's one thing said when another is meant
 He's around confusing you to the end
 Seeing how changeable you feel
 Don't think that happiness is real
 And it's hard to justify
 The tangle you untie
 And there's more than meets the eye to the guy.</lyrics>
