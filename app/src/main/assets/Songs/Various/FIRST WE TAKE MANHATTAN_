.       Dm                            Am
 They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
.      Dm                             Am
 For trying to change the system from within
.      Dm                      Am
 I'm coming now I'm coming to reward   them
. G                F      E               Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
 I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
 I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

.    C                                G   F
 I'd really like to live beside you, baby 
.             C                              Am
 I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
.         C                                       Am
 But you see that line there moving through the station
.   G          F          E                       Am
 I told you I told you I told you I was one of those

 You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win
 You know the way to stop me but you don't have the discipline
 How many nights I prayed for this: to let my work begin
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 I don't like your fashion business, mister
 I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
 I don't like what happened to your sister
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  (chorus)

 And I thank you for those items that you sent me
 The monkey end the plywood violin
 I practiced every night and now I'm ready
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

 Remember me, I used to live for music
 Remember me, I brought your groceries in
 It's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin</lyrics>
