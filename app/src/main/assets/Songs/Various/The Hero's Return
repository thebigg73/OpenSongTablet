 Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?
 Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape.
 When I was their age all the lights went out.
 There was no time to whine or mope about.

.Cmaj7                      D
 And even now part of me flies over
.Cmaj7
 Dresden at angels one five.
.D      Cmaj7
 Though they'll never fathom it behind my
.                           D
 Sarcasm desperate memories lie.

 Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.
 'Cause that's the only time that I can really speak to you.
 And there is something that I've locked away
 A memory that is too painful
 To withstand the light of day.

.Cmaj7                      D       Cmaj7
 When we came back from the war the banners and
.                         D
 Flags hung on everyone's door.
.   Cmaj7
 We danced and we sang in the street and
.                 D
 The church bells rang.
.    G             C
 But burning in my heart,
.   G                C
 My memory smoulders on
.       G             C            Emadd9
 Of the gunners dying words on the intercom.</lyrics>
