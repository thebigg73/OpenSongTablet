.C
 They pulled in just behind the fridge
.G
 He laid her down - he frowns
.Dm
 Gee my life's a funny thing
.F
 Am I still too young
.C
 He kissed then and there
.G
 She took his ring took his babies
.Dm
 It him minutes took her nowhere
.F
 Heaven knows she'd've taken anything

.Em     F#m
 All night - she wants the young American
.Em          F#m
 It's all right - but she wants the young American

 Scanning life through the picture window
 She finds the slinky vagabond
 He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
 Heaven forbid she'll taken anything
 But the freak and his type - all for nothing
 He misses a step and cuts his hand
 Showing nothing he swoops like a song
 She cries where have all papa's heroes gone

 All night - she wants the young American
 It's all right - but she wants the young American

 All the way from Washington
 Her breadwinner begs of the bathroom floor
 We live for just these twenty years
 Do we have to die for fifty more

 All night - she wants the young American
 It's all right - but she wants the young American

 Do you remember president Nixon
 Do you remember all the bills you have to pay
 or even yesterday .................................</lyrics>
