.F        C
 Lay a whisper on my pillow,
.        F             G
 leave a winter on the ground
.              C                   F
 I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
.       Dm               G
 in the bedroom and all around
.             Am          C              F
 Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

.G                       C
 It must have been love, but its over now
.F                     Dm      Am
 It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
.G                      C
 It must have been love but its over now
.F                 Dm                Am
 from the moment we touched till the time had run out

.G    C
 Make believing, we're together
.         F                 G
 that I'm sheltered by hour heart
.           C                      Fm
 But in and outside I've turned to water
.           Dm              G
 like a teardrop in your palm
.          Am             C             F
 And its hard, winter's day, I dream away

.G                       C
 It must have been love, but its over now
.F                 Dm         Am
 It was all I wanted, now I'm living without
.G                      C
 It must have been love but its over now
.Gm            C                           Bb
 Its where the water flows, its where the wind blows

.   C                  F
 It must have been love but its over now
.Bb                       Gm       Dm
 It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
.C                      F                  Bb
 It must have been love, but its over now, from the moment we touched
.Gm       Dm              C
 till the time had run out. Yeah it must have been love .. repeat and fade</lyrics>
