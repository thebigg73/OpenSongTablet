.     C             Am            F               C
 I am sailing, I am sailing home again 'cross the sea.
.     D7             Am            Dm7             C      G7
 I am sailing stormy waters, to be near you, to be free.  

 I am flying, I am flying like a bird 'cross the sea.
 I am flying passing high clouds, to be near you, to be free.

 Can you hear me, can you hear me, thru the dark night far away?
 I am dying, forever trying to be with you; who can say?

 Can you hear me, can you hear me, thru the dark night far away?
 I am dying, forever trying to be with you; who can say?

 We are sailing, we are sailing 'cross the sea.
 We are sailing stormy waters, to be near you, to be free.

.G7             Dm              C
 Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.
.G7             Dm              C
 Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free.</lyrics>
