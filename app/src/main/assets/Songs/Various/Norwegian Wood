.D            D/C#             D   C        G   D
 I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
.D            D/C#               D    C     G   D
 She showed me her room isn't it good Norwegian wood

.    Dm                                         G
 She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
.    Dm                                           Em   A
 But I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

.D          D/C#          D    C        G   D
 I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine
.D               D/C#             D    C         G   D
 We talked until two and then she said it's time for bed

.    Dm                                               G
 She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
.  Dm                                                Em  A
 I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

.D           D/C#        D    C         G   D
 And when I awoke I was alone this bird had flown
.D          D/C#          D    C    G    D
 So I lit a fire isn't it good Norwegian wood</lyrics>
