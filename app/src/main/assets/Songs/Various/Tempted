;Squeeze

;Intro:

.B       B/A      E/G#      E
 / / / /  / / / /  / / / /  / / / /	(2x)

;Verse 1:
.            B              D#m/A#          G#m
 I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste, a flannel for my face
.C#/F                       Em
 Pajamas, a hairbrush, new shoes and a case
.   Bm                               F#m               G/A A
 I said to my reflection, "let's get out of this place"
.  D         E                            G
 Passed the church and the steeple, the laundry on the hill
. B
 Billboards and the buildings
.A/E            C#/F
 Memories of it still keep
.Bm/F#         E
 Calling and calling
.    Bm/F#         G/F           E  E/D
 But forget it all     I know I will

;Chorus:
.B               B/A       E/G# E
 Tempted by the fruit of another
.B                B/A        E/G#   E
 Tempted but the truth is discovered
.             C#
 What's been going on
.         F#
 Now that you have gone
.             B  B/A
 There's no other
.E/G#             E         B   B/A
 Tempted by the fruit of another
.E/G#              E          C#m   Em
 Tempted but the truth is discovered

;Verse 2:
 I'm at the carpark, the airport, the baggage carousel
 The people keep on grabbing, ain't wishing I was well
 I said, "It's no occasion, it's no story I can tell"
 At my bedside, empty pocket, a foot without a sock
 Your body gets much closer
 I fumble for the clock
 Alarmed by the seduction
 I wish that it would stop

;Repeat chorus

;Verse 3 (half-length)
 I bought a novel, some perfume, a fortune over you
 But it's not my conscience that hates to be untrue
.   Bm                              F#m                 G/A A D
 I asked of my reflection, "tell me what is there to do"
