.Am7       Dm7                      G+       G
           I can feel your body              
.Am7       F/Dm7                      G+       G
           When I`m lying in bed               
.Am7       Dm7                  G+  G
           There's too much confusion
.Am7       F/Dm7        G+             G
           Going around through my head

.F                        E7
 And it makes me so angry 
.                             Am Am-     Am7        D7
 To know that the flame still burns                 
.F                     E7
 Why can't I get over? 
.                 F      E7
 When will I ever learn  

.    Am7 Dm7      G+     G             Am7 Dm7       G+      G
 Old love,                    leave me alone                 
.    Am7 Dm7      G+     G          Am7 Dm7          G+     G
 Old love,                    go on home                    

.Am7       Dm7                G+       G
           I can see your face         
.Am7       F/Dm7                        G+       G
           But I know that it's not real         
.Am7       Dm7                  G+     G
           It's just an illusion       
.Am7       F/Dm7                         G+       G
           Caused by how I used to feel           

.F                        E7
 And it makes me so angry 
.                                   Am Am-    Am7       D7
 To know that the flame will always burn                
.F                    E7
 I'll never get over  
.                           F      E7
 I know now that I'll never learn  

.    Am7 Dm7      G+     G                 Dm7       G+       G
 Old love,                    leave me alone                  
.    Am7       G+     G          Am7 Dm7        G+       G
 Old love,                 go on home
