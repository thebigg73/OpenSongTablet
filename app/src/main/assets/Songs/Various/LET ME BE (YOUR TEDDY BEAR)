 A.   Oh, baby let me be your loving teddy bear

 Oh, let me be your teddy bear.

 You love enough

 A.   That's why I want to be, your teddy bear
 Pull a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
 Oh, let me be your teddy bear.

 A.   Baby, let me be around you every night
 Run your face through my hands and caught to me real tight
 Oh, let me be your teddy bear.

 B.   I don't wanna . . .

 A.   That's why I want to be . . .

 And girls won't leave their teddy bear.</lyrics>
