;Intro
.C   C   Dm   Dm
              
.C                C             Dm                      Dm
 Every night, I'm lying in bed, holding you close in my dreams
.C                      C                        Dm                    Dm
 Thinking about all the things that we said, and coming apart at the seams
.Em                    Dm           Em                 F/G
 We try to talk it over, but the words come out too rough
.  C                       Dm                       C     G7
 I know you were trying to give me the best of your love  

.C                    C                 Dm                       Dm
 Beautiful faces, and loud empty places, look at the way that we live
.C                   C                   Dm                     Dm
 Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine, left us so little to give
.Em                             Dm                   Em                  F/G
 That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud that we could never rise above
.    C                   Dm                      C     G7
 But here in my heart, I give you the best of my love  

;Chorus

.         C            C        Dm                     Dm
 Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
.         C            C        Dm                     Dm
 Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
.Fm7       Fm7                     C            C
 I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream  
.         Fm7                     Fm7                     Dm    G7
 It was a quiet night and I would be all right if I could go on sleeping

.    C               C                  Dm                    Dm
 But every morning I wake up and worry, what's gonna happen today?
.C                        C                     Dm                   Dm
 You see it your way, and I see it mine, but we both see it slipping away
.Em                          Dm            Em                Dm      G7
 You know we always had each other baby, I guess that wasn't enough o-o-ohh
.    C                   Dm                      C     G
 But here in my heart, I give you the best of my love  

.         C            C        Dm                     Dm
 Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
.         C            C        Dm                     Dm
 Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love
