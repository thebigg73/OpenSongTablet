 I've been on tenter-hooks ending in dirty looks,
 Listening to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that.
 She said that's that.  I don't wanna chitter chat.
 Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat.
.E7
 Pump it up when you don't really need it.
 Pump it up until you can feel it.

 Down in the pleasure centre, hell bent or heaven sent,
 Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander.
 There's nothing under hand that she wouldn't understand.
 Pump it up until you can feel it.
 Pump it up when you don't really need it.

 She's been a bad girl.  She's like a chemical.
 Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic.
 You wanna torture her.  You wanna talk to her.
 All the things you bought for her, putting up your temp'rature.
 Pump it up until you can feel it.
 Pump it up when you don't really need it.

.E7
 Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin,
 You put your passion out under the presure pin.
.B7
 Fall into submission, hit and run transmision.
 No use wishing now for any other sin
.E7
 Pump it up until you can feel it.
 Pump it up when you don't really need it.
