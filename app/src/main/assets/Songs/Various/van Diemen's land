.        G       C       G   C  G
 Hold me now, oh hold me now    
.          Em   C        D
 Till this hour has gone around
.        Bm                 Em   C
 And I'm gone on the rising tide 
.       G    D            G    C  G
 For to face van Diemen's land    

 It's a bitter pill I swallow here
 To be rent from one so dear
 We fought for justice and not for gain
 But the magistrate sent me away

 Now kings will rule and the poor will toil
 And tear their hands as they tear the soil
 But a day will come in the dawning age
 When an honest man sees an honest wage

 Hold me now, hold me now
 Till this hour has gone around
 And I'm gone on the rising tide
 For to face Van Diemen's land

 Still the gunman rules and widows pay
 A scarlet coat now a black beret
 They thought that blood and sacrifice
 Could out of death bring forth a life
