;Play A-barre chords on the chorus.

;Tune down 1/2-step:  Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb

.Am                 G
 Im on my time with everyone
.Am              G
 I have very bad posture
.C             D          A#
 Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
.C                D               A#
 Distill the life thats inside of me
.C             D          A#
 Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
.C     D   A#
 Im anemic royalty

 Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
 So I can sigh eternally

 Im so tired I cant sleep
 Im a liar and a thief
 Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
 Im anemic royalty

 Im on warm milk and laxatives
 Cherry-flavored antacids

 (End on Am)
;
; Tips:  Slide up fron the C barre to the D barre during the
; chorus.  During the verse, play F# G E on the low E string as
; the change between the G and Am.
