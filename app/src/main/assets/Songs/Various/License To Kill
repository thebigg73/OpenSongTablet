; Transcribed by MH from Bob Dylan's (best!) album, "Infidels".
; I have written this in the key of C so it can be easily transposed: to
; play it in the original key (F#) put a capo on fret 6.
; Modifications/discussions welcome.
; **  The chords marked Fmaj7 and Csus4 I play as (xx3210) and (x33010),
;     respectively.
; *** The chord sequences for verses 2, 3 and 4 are the same as verse 1.

;VERSE 1
.C                    Am
 Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth
.       G                C
 He can do with it as he please
.       C            Am          G
 And if things don't change soon, he will
.    F                     C
 Oh, man has invented his doom
.      C        C        G   F
 First step was touching the moon
.              Am   F           Am F
 Now there's a woman on my block
.             Am   F                  Am   F
 She just sit there as the night grow still
.        C               G                  C  Fmaj7 Csus4 C
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill             **

;VERSE 2 ***
 Now, they take him and they teach him
 And they groom him for life
 And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill
 Then they bury him with stars
 Sell his body like they do used cars
 Now there's a woman on my block
 She just sit there facin' the hill
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill

;VERSE 3
 Now, he's hell bent for destruction
 He's afraid and confused
 And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
 All he believes are his eyes
 And his eyes they just tell him lies
 But there's a woman on my block
 Sitting there in a cold chill
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill

.       Am
 May be noisemaker, spirit maker
.C
 Heartbreaker, backbreaker
.F                  C
   Leave no stone unturned
.          Am
 May be an actor in a plot
.              C
 That might be all that you got
.          Dm                 G
 Till your error you clearly learn

;VERSE 4
 Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
 And when he sees his reflection he's fulfilled
 Oh, man is opposed to fair play
 He wants it all and he wants it his way
 Now, there's a woman on my block
 She just sit there as the night grow still
 She say who gonna take away his license to kill
