.C
 I wanted so badly   Somebody other than me
 Staring back at me   But you were gone
 I wanted to see you walking backwards
 And get the sensation of you coming home
 I wanted to see you walking away from me
 Without the sensation of you leaving me alone

 CHORUS:
.         Dm         C                   Dm         C
 Time and time again     (Am)   Time and time again    (Am)
.         Dm         C                  F
 Time and time again            I can't please myself

.C
 I wanted the ocean to cover over me
 I wanna sink slowly without getting wet
 Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely
 And I'll walk on water every chance I get

;CHORUS

.Bb C F
   
.F                      Bb           F
 So when are you coming home   Sweet angel?
.                Bb           F    Dm
 You leaving me alone?   All alone?
.            C                             Bb                     (F)
 Well if I'm drowning darling, you'll come down this way on your own

.C
 I wish I was traveling on a freeway
 Beneath this graveyard western sky
 I'm gonna set fire to this city
 And out into the desert we're gonna ride
