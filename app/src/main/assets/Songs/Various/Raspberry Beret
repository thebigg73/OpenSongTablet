[Intro]  | A G | D/F# | G | D G A |

.      A            G         D/F#
 I was working part time in a five-and-dime,
.   G                   D G A
 My boss was Mr. McGee.     
.                   G             D/F#
 He told me several times that he didn't like my kind,
.       G                        D G A
 'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely.     
.                 G          D/F#
 Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing,
.    G                               D G A
 But different than the day before.      
.              G        D/F#
 That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
.           G
 She walked in through the out door (out door).

;Chorus:
.           A   G          D/F#
 She wore a Raspberry beret
.    G                  D    G    A
 The kind U find in a second hand store
.    G          D/F#
 Raspberry beret
.    G                                D    A
 And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
.    G          D/F#
 Raspberry beret
.          E    A
 I think I love her

.A              G                    D/F#
 Built like she was, uh, she had the nerve 2 ask me
.     G                          D G A
 If I planned 2 do her any harm      
.                                     G                D/F#
 So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and-a we went riding
.G                               D G A
 Down by old man Johnson's farm      
.                     G          D/F#
 I said now, overcast days never turned me on
.    G                                         D G A
 But something about the clouds and her mixed      
.           G            D/F#
 She wasn't 2 bright but I could tell
.                G
 When she kissed me
 She knew how 2 get her kicks

;Chorus:
.           A   G           D/F#
 She wore a Raspberry beret 
.    G                  D    G    A
 The kind U find in a second hand store
.    G           D/F#
 Raspberry beret 
.    G                                D    A
 And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
.    G           D/F#
 Raspberry beret 
.          E    A
 I think I love her

.D        A/C#           D       A/C#
 The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof,
.N.C.
 And the horses wonder who U are.
.D       A/C#                D              A/C#
 Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees 
.  N.C.
 U feel like a movie star
.        G        F#m            E
 Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
.               N.C.
 But I tell ya, if I had the chance 2 do it all again
.  G                               F#m
 I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most,
.       E
 With a girl as fine as she was then.
