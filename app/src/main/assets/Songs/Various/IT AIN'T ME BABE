.G               C      G             D          G
 Go 'way from my window leave at your own chosen speed
.G                   C               G       D       G
 I'm not the one you want, Babe, I'm not the one you need.
.    Bm                 Am                Bm              Am
 You say you're looking for someone never weak but always strong
.      Bm             Am               Bm               Am
 To protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong
.    C                          D
 Someone to open each and every door
.             G
 But it ain't me, Babe,
.C       D            G
 No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
.         C         D       G
 It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.

 Go lightly from the ledge, Babe, go lightly on the ground,
 I'm not the one you want, Babe, I will only let you down.
 You say you're looking for someone
 who will promise never to part
 Someone to close his eyes for you, someone to close his heart
 Someone who will die for you and more
 But it ain't me, Babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
 It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.

 Go melt back in the night, Babe,
 everything inside is made of stone,
 There's nothing in here moving and anyway I'm not alone
 You say you're looking for someone
 Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
 To gather flowers constantly and to come each time you call
 A love of your life and nothing more
 But it ain't me, Babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
 It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.</lyrics>
