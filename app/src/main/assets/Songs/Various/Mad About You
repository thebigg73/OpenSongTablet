;Intro:

.Am                     Am/C
 A stone's throw from Jerusalem
.Fmaj7                             Eaug
 I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
.Am                    Am/C
 And though a million stars were shining
.Fmaj7                              Eaug
 My heart was lost on a distant planet
.Am                     Am/C
 That whirls around the April moon
.Fmaj7                  Eaug
 Whirling in an arc of sadness
.Am                  Am/C  E                    Eaug
 I'm lost without you      I'm lost without you 

.Fmaj7                  Dm7
 Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
.    Adim7          E
 And fall into the sea
.    Am           Am/G       F        E  Am
 I'm mad about you      I'm mad about you

 And from the dark secluded valleys
 I heard the ancient songs of sadness
 But every step I thought of you
 Every footstep only you
 And every star a grain of sand
 The leavings of a dried up ocean
 Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?

 They say a city in the desert lies
 The vanity of an ancient king
 But the city lies in broken pieces
 Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
 These are the works of man
 This is the sum of our ambition
 It would make a prison of my life
 If you became another's wife
 With every prison blown to dust
 My enemies walk free
 I'm mad about you   I'm mad about you

.Cadd9                       E7aug
 And I have never in my life 
.                    Asus4
 Felt more alone than I do now
.A#                              F
 Although I claim dominions over all I see
.C/E
 It means nothing to me
.              Dm7
 There are no victories
.           Adim7               E    E7
 In all our histories, without love  

;repeat first verse
.    Fmaj7               Dm7
 And though you hold the keys to ruin
.    Adim7        E
 Of everything I see
.     Fmaj7         Dm7
 With every prison blown to dust,
.    Adim7        E
 My enemies walk free
.       Fmaj7            Dm7
 Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
.    Adim7          E
 And fall into the sea
.    Am           Am/G       F        E  Am
 I'm mad about you      I'm mad about you</lyrics>
