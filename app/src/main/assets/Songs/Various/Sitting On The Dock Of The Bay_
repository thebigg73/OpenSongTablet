.G                      B7
 Sitting in the morning sun;
.        C                        A
 I'll be sitting when the evening comes.
.G                       B7
 Watching the ships roll in
.      C                    A
 And I watch 'em roll away again, yeah.

[C
.G                          E
 Sitting on the dock of the bay
.             G           E
 Watching the tide roll away.
.         G                          A
 I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
.        G        E
 Wasting time.

 I left my home in Georgia
 Headed for the 'Frisco bay
 'Cause I had nothin to live for
 And look like nothing's gonna come my way

 So I'm just...
;repeat chorus

.G    D7                          G
 Look like nothing's gonna change 
. D7        C                      G
 Everything still remains the same 
.  D7                        G          F
 I can't do what people tell me to do.  
.                      D
 So I guess I'll remain the same.

 Sittin here resting my bones
 And this loneliness won't leave me alone
 It's two thousand miles I roamed
 Just to make this dock my home

 Now, I'm just...
;repeat chorus
