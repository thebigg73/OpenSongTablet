.            G                            C                   G
 When you're lost in the rain, in Juarez, and it's Eastertime too
.          G                      C                     G
 When your gravity fails, and negativity don't pull you through
.      C                                                 G
 Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
.                 D                              C                         G
 They've got some hungry women there and they'll really make a mess out of you

;Intro (2x)

 If you see Saint Annie, please tell her thanks a lot
 I cannot maove and my fingers, they are all in a knot
 I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
 And my best, my doctor, won't even say what it is that I've got

 Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
 She speaks good English, and she invites you up into her room
 And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
 And she takes your voice, and leaves you howling at the moon

 Up on housing project hill, it's either fortune or fame
 You must pick one or the other, though neither fo them ought to be what they claim
 And if you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
 Cause the cops don't need you, and man, they expect the same

 Now all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
 How they blackmailed the sergeant at arms into leaving his post
 And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast
 Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost

 I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff
 Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
 But the joke was one me, there was nobody there to even bluff
 I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough</lyrics>
