 {cb:[Intro] (tremolo B G# F# E)}

.                 E                   F#m
 A.   It's now or never, come hold me tight
.                   B7         E
 Kiss me my darling, be mine tonight
.   Am                E                 B7
 Tomorrow will be too late, it's now or never
.               E
 My love won't wait.

.                  E                           F#m
 B.   When I first saw you with your smile so tender
.                      B7           E
 My heart was captured,  my soul surrendered
.             E                        F#m
 I'd spend a lifetime waiting for the right time
.               E                B7      E
 Now that your near the time is here at last.

 A.   It's now or . . .

 B.   Just like a willow, we would cry an ocean
 If we lost true love and sweet devotion
 Your lips excite me, let your arms invite me
 For who knows when we'll meet again this way

 A.   It's now or . . .</lyrics>
