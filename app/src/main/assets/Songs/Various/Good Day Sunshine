.G        D         G        D         C7
 Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine.

.          F    Dm7           G7          C7
 I need to laugh and when the sun is out, I've got
.              F
 someting I can laugh about.
.C7     F   Dm7     G7         C7
 I feel good in a special way, I'm in love, and it's
.  F
 a sunny day.
.G        D         G        D         C7
 Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine.

 We take a walk, the sun is shining down, burns my feet as they touch the ground.
 Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine.

 And then we lie beneath a shady tree, I love her and she's loving me.
 She feels good, she knows she's looking fine.
 I'm so proud to know that she's mine.

.G        D         G        D         G        D7
 Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
.G        D7        G        D7
 Good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
