.             Fm7
 Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
.      Eb            Fm
 I'm a womans man,no time to talk
. Fm7
 Music loud and women warm
.           Eb                 Fm
 Iv'e been kicked around since I was born
.          Bb7
 And now it's alright,it's ok, you may look the other way
 We can try to understand the New York Times' effect on man

 Well now,I get low and I get high
.            Eb            Fm

 I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose

 We can try to understand the New York Times' effect on man
