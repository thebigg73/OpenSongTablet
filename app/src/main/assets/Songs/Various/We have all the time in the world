.A  Gbm A   Gbm
            
.Gbm           A         Gbm           Dbm7 Em
      We have  all   the time  in the world 
.Em               Bm        E7
 Time enough for life to unfould
.E7                 A                    E7
 all the precious things   love has in store
.E7      A           Gbm          Dbm7 Em
 We have all    the love  in the world 
.Em                Bm              E7                    A
 If that's all we love  you will find   we need nothing more

.        C             Bb          F     F7+
 Every step    of the way    will find   us
.Bb        Ab             Db             E7
 With the cares   of the world    far behind us

.         A          Gbm          Dbm7
 We have  all   the time  in the world
.         Em             Gbm           Bm7           A
 Just for love  nothing more   nothing less  only  love

 A  /  Gbm  // x3

.        C            Bb           F     F7+
 Every step    of the way    will find   us
.Bb       Ab             Db              E7
 With the cares   of the world    far behind us

.         A          Gbm          Dbm7
 We have  all   the time  in the world
.         Em             Gbm           Bm7           A
 Just for love  nothing more   nothing less  only  love
