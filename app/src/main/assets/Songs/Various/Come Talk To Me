;intro:
.A D      A D      A D      E Gbm
                              
.D A
   

.    A               D/A                  A
 The wretched desert takes it's form, The jackal proud and tight,
.   A               D/A                  A
 In search of you I feel my way, Through slowest heaving night
.D         Dsus4          A
 Whatever fear invents, I swear it make no sense
.Bm                      G
 I reach out through the border fence
.     A
 Come down, come talk to me

 Unuttered words hold fast With reptile tongue the lightning lashes
 Towers built to last Darkness creeps in like a thief
 And offers no relief Why are you shaking like a leaf?
 Come on, come talk to me

;chorus:
[C]
.   A/Db           D            A/Db           D
 Ah please talk to me Won't you please talk to me
.         A/Db          D       E                Gbm
 We can unlock this misery Come on, come talk to me
.  A/Db            D          A/Db        D
 I did not come to steal This all is so unreal
.          A/Db            D         E                Gbm
 Can't you show me how you feel Come on, come talk to me
.             D                A
 Come talk to me, come talk to me
[]

 The earthly power sucks shadowed milk, Come on, come talk to me
 Come on, come talk to me Come on, come talk to me
 Come on, come talk to me
 Come on, come talk to me From sleepy tears undone
 From nippled skin as smooth as silk, The bugles blow as one
 You lie there with your eyes half closed, Like there's no-one there at all
 There's a tension pulling on your face
 Come on, come talk to me

;chorus2
 Won't you please talk to me If you'd just talk to me
 Unblock this misery If you'd only talk to me
 Don't you ever change your mind Now your future's so defined
 And you act so deaf so blind Come on, come talk to me
 Come talk to me, come talk to me

;bridge:
.A                          D/A
   I can imagine the moment   Breaking out through the silence
.A                                       A                                D/A
   All the things that we both might say   And the heart it will not be denied
.                                A
 'Til we're both on the same damn side All the barriers blown away

;chorus improvisations:
 I said please talk to me Won't you please come talk to me
 Just like it used to be Come on, come talk to me
 I did not come to steal This all is so unreal
 Can you show me how you feel now Come on, come talk to me
 Come talk to me, come talk to me

 I said please talk to me If you'd just talk to me
 Unblock this misery If you'd only talk to me
 Don't you ever change your mind Now your future's so defined
 And you act so deaf so blind Come on, come talk to me
 Come talk to me, come talk to me</lyrics>
