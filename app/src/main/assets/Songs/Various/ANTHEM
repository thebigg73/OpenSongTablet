;NOTES:
;        * capo instrument at 1st fret
;        * all verses similar to 1st verse in chord structure

;Introduction:  Am    /G

.               C
 The birds they sang
 at the break of day
.      G
 Start again
.             C  C7
 I heard them say
.      E7
 Don't dwell on what
.    Am
 has passed away
.           G       Gsus4     G5  G7  G
 or what is yet to be.                

 The wars they will
 be fought again
 The holy dove
 be caught again
 bought and sold
 and bought again
 the dove is never free.

;chorus:
.         F          Bb        F
 Ring the bells that still can ring.
.            Bb           F
 Forget your perfect offering.
.           C        Bb        F
 There is a crack, a crack, in everything.
.               Dm                G    Gsus4   G
 That's how the light gets in.                 

 We asked for signs
 the signs were sent:
 the birth betrayed
 the marriage spent
 the widowhood
 of every government -
 signs for all to see.

 Can't run no more
 with the lawless crowd
 while the killers in high places
 say their prayers out loud.
 But they've summed up
 a thundercloud
 and they're going to hear from me.

;chorus

 You can add up the parts
 but you won't have the sum
 You can strike up the march,
 there is no drum
 Every heart
 to love will come
 but like a refugee.

;chorus

;chorus

 that's how the light gets in
 that's how the light gets in
