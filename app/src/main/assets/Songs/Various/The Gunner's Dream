.G  G+  Em  C  G  D  Em
                     

.G             G+
 Floating down through the clouds
.Em/G                  C
 Memories come rushing up to meet me now.
.       G
 In the space between the heavens
.           D                            C
 And in the corner of some foreign field,
.        G     Em C
 I had a dream,
.        G
 I had a dream.

.G            G+
 Goodbye Max, goodbye Ma.
.Em/G                          C
 After the service when you're walking slowly to the car
.        G                                D
 And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air,
.    Em                         Cmaj7                  D/C   C
 You hear the tolling bell, and touch the silk in your lapel,
.    G                                  D                   Em
 And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band,
.C                  D
 You take her frail hand and hold on to the dream.

.G  G+  Em  C  D  G  D  Em  D  C  D/C  G  D  C  G  Em  C  Em
                                                          

.G                G+
 A place to stay, enough to eat,
.Em                           C
 Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street.
.              G                                    D
 Where you can speak out loud about your doubts and fears,
.                Em
 And what's more no-one ever disappears,
.                                    Cmaj7
 You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.
.G                D
 You can relax on both sides of the tracks,
.            Em                  C                      D7/C
 And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control,
.    G                            D
 And everyone has recourse to the law,
.    C                            G    Em
 And no-one kills the children anymore.
.C                                 G
 No-one kills the children anymore.

.C             D          G         D        Em    D
 Night after night, going round and round my brain,
.    C        D            G
 His dream is driving me insane___________________.
.       G
 In the corner of some foreign field,
.    D
 The gunner sleeps tonight.
.Em                     C    D/C
 What's done is done.        
.   G                               D
 We cannot just write off his final scene.
.C                G     Em
 Take heed of his dream,
.C         Em
 Take heed.</lyrics>
