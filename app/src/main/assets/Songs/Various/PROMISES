.G
 I don't care if you never come home
.C                                G
 I don't mind if you just keep on rolling away on a distant sea cause
.D                                    G
 I don't love you and you don't *love me.

.G
 The cause of commotion when you come to town
.C
 Give 'em a smile and they melt
.        G
 And the lovers and friends are all good and fine,
.    D                                      G
 But I don't like yours and you don't *like mine.

.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la
.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la

.G
 I don't care what you do at night and
.C
 I don't care how you get your delights,
.     G
 I'll leave you alone, I'll just let it be
.D                                    G
 I don't love you and you don't *love me.

.C                   G6/B
 I've got a problem, can you relate,
.Am               G
 I've got a woman callin' love hate
.C              G6/B
 Even in doubt, We'll aways be friends
.Am                         G
 How could we know that the promises end?

.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la
.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la

.G
 I try to love you for years upon years,
.C
 You refuse to take me for real
.     G
 It's time you saw what I want you to see
.    D                                    G
 And I'd still love you if you just *like me.

.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la
.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la
.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la
.G  C      G           D
 La la---- la la la la la

 (At '*' play F# note to walk up to the G chord, it simultes the
 bass and it's the hook of the song, if you've heard it you will recognize it)</lyrics>
