.E                       E                   F#m B  F#m B
 There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar; 
.A          B                           E     E
 great expectations, ev'rybody's watchin' you.
.E            E                   F#m  B   F#m7 B
 People you meet they all seem to know you,
.A           B                               E             Absus4 Ab7
 even your old friends treat you like you're somethin' new.

.C#m           F#
 Johnny come lately,
.C#m             F#
 the new kid in town.
.C#m           F#
 Ev'rybody loves you,
.F#m                B7
 so don't let them down.

.E                E                F#m     B    F#m B
 You look in her eyes, the music begins to play,
.A          B                    E    E
 hopeless romantics, here we go again.
.E             E                             F#m B F#m7 B
 But after a while you're lookin' the other way, 
.           A        B                      E Absus4 Ab7
 it's those restless hearts that never mend.

.C#m           F#
 Johnny come lately,
.C#m             F#
 the new kid in town.
.C#m             F#
 Will she still love you
.F#m7             B7
 when you're not around?

.E E B B A B E A E F#m E

.B7                B7                   E        E
 There's so many things you should have told her,
.B7               B7                        C#m
 but night after night you're willing to hold her,
.     B    F#7   Am7          C    D
 just hold her, tears on your shoulder.

.G                   G                       Am7  D   Am7 D
 There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you.
.C              D             G          G
 Doesn't really matter which side you're on.
.G                G                          Am7  D  D7
 You're walkin' away and they're talkin' behind you, 
.          C                     D                   G    B7
 they will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along.

.Em7                   A
 Where've you been lately?
.Em7                      A
 There's a new kid in town.
.Em7           A
 Ev'rybody loves him (don't they?)
.Am7                 B7                       E Abm7 A
 Now he's holdin' her and you're still around.

.B7                     E   Abm7 A
 There's a new kid in town, 
.B7                        E   Abm7 A Am7 E
 just another new kid in town. 
.E                              C#m            C#m E
 Ev'rybody's talkin' 'bout the new kid in town.
.E                              C#m            C#m
 Ev'rybody's talkin' 'bout the new kid in town.
.          E                    E
 There's a new kid in town, (I don't want to hear it)
.          C#m                    C#m
 There's a new kid in town, (I don't want to hear it)</lyrics>
