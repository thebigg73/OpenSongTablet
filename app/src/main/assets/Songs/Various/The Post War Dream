.Bb/F    F                     Bb
 Tell me true, tell me why was Jesus crucified?
.C                   C7    F
 Is it for this that daddy died?
.Bb/F   F
 Was it you? Was it me?
.      Bb
 Did I watch too much T.V.?
.          C                            F  Bb/F
 Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
.F
 If it wasn't for the Nips
.F7       Bb
 Being so good at building ships,
.    C                         C9       F
 The yards would still be open on the Clyde.
.                             F7
 And it can't be much fun for them
.  Bb
 Beneath the rising sun
.     C                         C7 F
 With all their kids committing suicide.
.             Bb                         F
 What have we done, Maggie what have we done?
.              Bb
 What have we done to England?
.C         F                   A
 Should we shout, should we scream,
.      Bb       Bbm             F/C    Dm7
 "What happened to the post war dream?"
.Gm7        C7
 Oh, Maggie,
.       C7+          F    C Bb F
 Maggie what have we done?</lyrics>
