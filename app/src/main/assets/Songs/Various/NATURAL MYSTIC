.     Dm             G              Am  Am
 There's a natural mystic flow thru' the air,
.       Dm        G              Am   Am
 if you listen carefully now you will hear.
.      Dm           Am
 This could be the first trumpet,
.    Dm          Am
 might as well be the last.
.     Dm                   Am
 Many more will have to suffer,
.     Dm                   Am
 many more will have to die,
.        Am  Am
 don't ask me why.

 Things are not the way they used to be,	I won't tell no lie.
 One and all have to face reality now.
 'Tho I've tried to find the answer
 to all the questions they ask.
 'Tho I know it's impossible
 to go living through the past,
 don't tell no lie.
 There's a natural mystic bloom thru' the air, can't keep them down.</lyrics>
