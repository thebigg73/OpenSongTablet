. E
 Ever since my baby left me,
 I found a new place to dwell.
.                             E7
 It's down at the end of lonely street at Heartbreak Hotel.

[C]
. A7
 You make me so lonely baby, I get so lonely,
.B7                       E
 I get so lonely  I could die.
[]

 And although it's always crowded,
 you still can find some room.
 Where broken hearted lovers do cry away their gloom.

;(repeat chorus)

 Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
 and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
 Well they been so long on lonely street
 They ain't ever gonna look back.

;(repeat chorus)

 Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
 and you got a tale to tell.
 Just take a walk down lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel.

;(repeat chorus and fade)</lyrics>
