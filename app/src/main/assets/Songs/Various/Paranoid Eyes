.G                   C                         G
 Button your lip and don't let the shield slip.
.                          C            G
 Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask.
.C                                                      G        D C
 And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
.        G     D     C        G/B  Am  D  Am
 You can hide, hide, hide,                
.                G
 Behind paranoid eyes.

.        G                          C                   G
 You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar,
.                        C                    G
 Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar.
.C
 Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
.         G    D      C
 With the boys in the crowd.
.    G     D     C    Am D Am
 You hide, hide, hide,
.                 G
 Behind petrified eyes.

.C  G  C  G  C  G  Em  D  Am  G
                              

.      G                          C                 G
 You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory.
.                              C                   G
 Now you're lost in a haze of alchohol soft middle age.
.    C                                         G    D C
 The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high.
.        G     D     C       Am  D  Am
 And you hide, hide, hide,          
 Behind brown and mild eyes.</lyrics>
