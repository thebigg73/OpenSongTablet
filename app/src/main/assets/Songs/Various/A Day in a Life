 (intro)                                               
.G          Bm             Em   C       Em            Am
 I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade
.Cmaj7

.G               Bm               Em   C           F            Em
 And thought the news were rather sad, well I just had to laugh 
.E?

.C         F          Em   Cmaj7
 I saw the photograph      

.G           Bm            Em   C         Em              Am
 He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had

 changed 
.G          Bm               Em      C               F
 A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before
.Em                        E?                       C
 Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

.G       Bm             Em   C           Em            Am          Cmaj7
 I saw a film today, oh boy, the england army had just won the war 
.G          Bm             Em   C          F
 A crowd of people turned away, but I just had to look
.Em     E?       C
 Having read the book
.            Bm        G        G?      E
 I'd love to turn .... you .... on .... 

.E                                                    D
 Wake up, fell out of bed, dragged a combed across my head
.         E                  F#m7               E            F#m7
 Found my way downstairs and dranked a cup, and looking up I noticed I w
 as late
.E                                                            D
 Grabbed my coat, and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat
.         E                F#m7             E                    F#m7
 Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and somebody spoke and I went in
 to a dream

.C          G         D          A               C          G         D          A
 Ahhhhh...                                       Ahhhhh...                       

.G          Bm             Em   C             Em                 Am
 I read the news today, oh boy, four thousand holes in Blackburn Lac
.        Cmaj7
 anshire 
.G              Bm                Em     C           F
 And though the holes were rather small, they had to count them all
.Em                              E?                       C
 Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
.            Bm        G        G?      E
 I'd love to turn .... you .... on ....</lyrics>
