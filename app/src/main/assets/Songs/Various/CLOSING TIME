;Introduction:
 G    /D    /G   D

.          G
 Ah, we're drinking and we're dancing
 and the band is really happening
.        Em
 and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high,
.       Bm
 And my very sweet companion,
 she's the Angel of Compassion
.          Em
 and she's rubbing half the world against her thigh.
.          C
 And every drinker, every dancer
 lifts a happy face to thank her
.        G               B7              Em
 and the fiddler fiddles something so sublime
.        D
 all the women tear their blouses off
 the men they dance on the polka dots
.         C
 and it's partner found and it's partner lost
 and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
.     G
 it's CLOSING TIME
.          C
 Yeah, the women tear their blouses off
 the men they dance on the polka dots
.         G                      B7
 and it's partner found and it's partner lost
.         Em                   C
 and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
.     G              D
 it's CLOSING TIME   

.      G
 We're lonely, we're romantic
 and the cider's laced with acid
.        Em
 and the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?"
.        Bm
 And the moon is swimming naked
 and the summer night is fragrant
.       Em
 with a mighty expectation of relief
.      C
 So we struggle and we stagger
 down the snakes and up the ladder
.       G               B7            Em
 to the tower where the blessed hours chime
.      D
 and I swear it happened just like this:
 a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
.    C
 the Gates of Love they budged an inch
 I can't say much has happened since
.    G
 but CLOSING TIME
.  C
 I swear it happned just like this:
 a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
.    G                  B7
 the Gates of Love they budged an inch
.  Em                 C
 I can't say much has happened since
 (can't say much has happned since, can't say much has happened since)
.    G             D
 but CLOSING TIME, CLOSING TIME

.  Em
 I loved you for your beauty
 but that doesn't make a fool of me
.Bm
 you were in it for your beauty too
.      Em
 and I loved you for your body
 there's a voice that sounds like God to me
.A                                A7
 declaring (declaring) declaring (declaring)
.D
 declaring that you're body's really you (really really really really)
.  C
 I loved you when our love was blessed
 I love you now there's nothing left
.    G            B7           Em
 but sorrow and a sense of overtime
.      D
 and I miss you since the place got wrecked
 but I just don't care what happens next
.C
 looks like freedom but it feels like death
 it's something in between, I guess
.     G
 it's CLOSING TIME
.        C
 Yeah. I miss you since the place got wrecked
 by the winds of change and the weeds of sex
.G                         B7
 looks like freedom but it feels like death
.     Em             C
 it's something in between, I guess
.     G           D
 it's CLOSING TIME
.            G
 Yeah, we're drinking and we're dancing
 but there's nothing really happening
.    Em
 The place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night
.       Bm
 And my very close companion
 gets me fumbing gets me laughing
.        Em
 she's a hundred but she's wearing something tight
.      C
 And I lift my glass to the Awful Truth
 which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth
.  G              B7            Em
 except to say it isn't worth a dime
.        D
 And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
 and it's once for the Devil and it's once for Christ
.        C
 but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
 we're busted in the blinding lights
.   G
 of CLOSING TIME
.    C
 The whole damn place goes crazy twice
 and it's once for the Devil and it's once for Christ
.        G                     B7
 but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
.      Em            C
 we're busted in the blinding lights
 (busted in the blinding lights)
 busted in the blinding lights
.   G             D
 of CLOSING TIME, CLOSING TIME

.        G
 Oh, the women tear their blouses off
.                                               D
 and the men they dance on the polka dots, it's CLOSING TIME
.         G
 And it's partner found, and it's partner lost
 and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
.     D
 it's CLOSING TIME
.  G
 I swear it happned just like this:
.                                   D
 A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss, it's CLOSING TIME
.    G
 The gates of love they budged an inch
.                                       D
 I can't say much has happned since but CLOSING TIME
.  G
 I loved you when our love was blessed
.                                         D
 I love you now, there's nothing left but CLOSING TIME
.      G
 And I missed you since our place gor wrecked
.                                                  D
 by the winds of change and the weeds of sex, it's CLOSING TIME</lyrics>
