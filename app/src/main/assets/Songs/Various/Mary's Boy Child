.G                C                 D          G
 Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,
.G                C                 G       D7        G
 Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

;Chorus:
.G         C        D7     G       Em       C    D
 Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today, and
.G        D/A  G/B C           G        D7        G
 man will live for evermore, because of Christmas day.
.G        C         D7     G     Em        C         D
 Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen to what they say, that
.G        D/A      C           G        D7        G
 man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

 While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
 them see a bright new shining star,
 them hear a choir sing, the music seemed to come from afar.
 Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, come to Bethlehem that night,
 them find no place to born the child, not a single room was in sight.

 By and by they find a little nook in a stable all forlorn,
 and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.
 Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,
 Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.</lyrics>
