.D   D6sus4 G       A           D
   Nobody's perfect, and that's something
.        D6sus4  G      A
 that I'm sure   she'll know
.      D                  D6sus4        G        A
 Cause trying to tell her lies from the truth at times
.        F#                        G   G9*
 is like trying to divide ice from snow
.D            D6sus4      G   A   D            D6sus4
   And when I knew it was over, I jumped into a taxi
.          G             A
 And said "Guess were to go"
.        D             D6sus4
 And the driver turned about and said,
. G                A
 "Finding what you want is like
.F#                        G    G9*
 Trying to divide ice from snow"

;chorus
[C
.   A      A9   G               G9
 So here I sit, rolling back to bed
.        A
 Knowing love is a hazard
.D6sus4       G      G9
 That I never guessed
.         D    D9sus4    D6sus4
 But from this side  of  morning
.  G             A    A7 A6sus4  A             D    D6sus4 G A D D6sus4 G A
 I couldn't care less,        I  couldn't care less.

.D   D6sus4 G       A
   Nobody's helpless, although
.    D      D6sus4    G          A
 I've never felt this helpless before
.    D            D6sus4       G             A
 And trying to persuade myself not to think about her
.        F#                            G       G9*
 Is like trying to tell the clouds not to pour 
.D          D6sus4       G
   And so I put down the bottle
.A             D               D6sus4
   While in my head time is collapsing
.        G            A
 And the currents run cold
.   D              D6sus4
 So I can curse her memory
.    G         A               F#
 But don't try telling me that she was not
.                G
 An emerald in a mountain of coal
.        G9*       F#
 Or that there's a crock of cures for cancer
.       G            G9*
 At the end of the rainbow.

;chorus

.    A                                   G
 And she's the kind of girl who won't forgive
.            D
 But will forget
.   G
 So take my from this party, driver
.A
 put me back to bed
.  A                               G              D
 I wanted to be loved but just got laughed at instead
.   G                   A  A9
 So if this taxi is for hire
.         G
 I'll get in the back
.                 G9                            A A7 A6sus4 A
 Just to tell the friction of the tarmac and the tyres. 
.DDD6sus4 G A D D6sus4 G A
         

.D      D6sus4 G      A            D
   So nobody's perfect, and that's something that
.    D6sus4 G       A
 I'm sure    she'll know
.    D            D6sus4
 And trying to persuade myself
.G             A
 Not to think about her is like
.F#                                 G   G9*
 Trying to tell the crockels not to crow
.        F#
 Or like trying to tell the striker
.       G               G9*
 Not to think about the goal.
