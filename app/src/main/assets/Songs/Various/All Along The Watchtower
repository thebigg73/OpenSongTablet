.Am            G                 F         G
 There must be some kind of way out of here
 Said the joker to the thief
 There's too much confusion
 I can't get no relief
 Buisness men they drink my wine
 Plowmen dig my earth
 None would ever compromise
 Nobody of this world
 No reason to get excited
 The thief he kindly spoke
 There are many here among us
 Who feel that life is but a joke
 But you and I we've been through that
 And this is not our place
 So let us stop talking falsely now
 The hour's getting late

 All along the watchtower
 Princess kept the view
 While all the women came and went
 Barefoot servants too
 Outside in the cold distance
 A wildcat did growl
 Two riders were approaching
 And the wind began to howl

 All along the watchtower
 All along the watchtower
 All along the watchtower</lyrics>
