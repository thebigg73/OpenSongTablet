 As I went home in Monday night, as drunk as drunk could be,
.  F                                  C      F
 I saw a horse outside the door where my old horse should be.
.        C                                          F
 Well, I called my wife and I said to her: Will you kindly tell to me,
.    C                            F         G7                  C
 Who owns that horse outside the door where my old horse should be?

.        C
 Are you drunk, you drunk, you silly old fool? Still you cannot see,
.                              F          G7       C
 That's the lovely sow that my mother had given to me.
.           C
 Well, it's many a-day I travelled, a hundred miles and more,
.                             G7          C
 but a sattle on a sow sure I never saw before.

 As I went home on Tuesday night, as drunk as drunk could be,
 I saw a coat behind the door, where my old coat should be.

 Are you drunk, you drunk, you silly old fool? Still you cannot see,

 But fingers in a night-gown sure I never saw before.

 As I went home on Sunday night, as drunk as drunk could be,
 I saw a thing in her thing, where my old thing should be.
 Well, I called my wife and I said to her: Will you kindly tell to me,
