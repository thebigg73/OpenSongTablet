.           G
 Well I'm a runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load
.                     D     C
 I've got seven women on my mind
.G                       D
 Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
.C                               G
 One says she's a friend of mine 
.          Em            C G
 Take it easy, take it easy
.              Am                C                   Em
 Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
.           C               G
 Lighten up while you still can
.           C                 G
 Don't even try to understand 
.            Am                 C                     G
 Just find a place to make your stand,  and take it easy

.            G
 Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
.            D        C
 Such a fine sight to see
.       G                 D
 It's a girl my lord in a flat-bed Ford
.        C                         G
 Slowin' down to take a look at me 
.           Em              CG
 Come on, baby, don't say maybe
.        Am                 C                  Em
 I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
.       C               G                  C             G
 We may lose and we may win, though we may never be here again
.        Am              C                G
 So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy

.            G
 Well, I'm a runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load
.                       D     C
 Got a world of trouble on my mind
.G                       D                          C               G
 Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find 
.          Em             C G
 Take it easy,  take it easy
.              Am                C                  Em
 Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
.        C G             C  G
 Come on baby, don't say maybe
.        Am                 C             G       CEm
 I gotta know of your sweet love is gonna save me</lyrics>
