.F                    Dm
 Oh the rag-man draws circles
.F                     Dm
 Up and down the block.
.    F                       Dm
 I'd ask him what the matter was
.      Bb                    C7
 But I know that he don't talk.
.        Bb                  F
 And the ladies treat me kindly
.    Dm                  F
 And furnish me with tape
.    Dm                 F
 But deep inside my heart
.  Bb                F
 I know I can't escape
.Am
 Oh Mama,
 Can this really be the end
.           F      C     Dm
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
.  F        Bb              F
 with the Memphis blues again

 Well, Shakespear, he's in the alley
 With his pointed shoes and his bells.
 Speaking to a french girl,
 Who says she knows me well.
 And I would send a message
 To find out if she's talked,
 Post the post office has been stolen
 And the mail box is locked.
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 Mona tried to tell me
 To stay far away from the train line.
 She said that all the railroad men
 Drink your blood like wine.
 An' I said "Oh, I didn't know that
 But then again there's only one I've met
 An' he just smoked my eyelids
 An' punched my cigarette"
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 Grandpa died last week
 And now he's buried in the rock
 But everybody talk about
 How badly they were shocked.
 But me I expected it to happen
 I knew he'd lost control
 When he built a fire on main street
 And shot it full of holes.
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 Now the senator can down here
 Showing everyone his gun.
 Handing out free tickets
 To the wedding of his son.
 An' me I nearly got busted
 An wouldn't it be my luck
 To get caught without a ticket
 And be discovered beneath a truck
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 Now the preacher looked so baffled
 When I asked him why he dressed
 With twenty pounds of headlines
 Stapled to his chest
 But he cursed when I proved to him
 Then I whispered not even you can hide.
 You see you're just like me
 I hope your satisfied
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 Now the rainman gave men two cures
 Then he said "Jump right in"
 The one was Texas medicine
 The other railroad gin.
 An like a fool I mixed them
 An' it strangled up my mind
 An' now people just get uglier
 An' I have no sense of time.
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 When Ruthie says come see her
 In her honkey-yonk lagoon,
 Where I can watch her waltz for free
 'Neath her Panamanian moon.
 An' I say, "Aw come on now
 You must know about my dedutante."
 An' she says, "Your debutante knows just what you need
 But I know what you want."
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.

 Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
 Where the neon madmen climb
 They all fall there so perfectly.
 It all seems so well timed.
 An' here I sit so patiently
 Waiting to find out what price
 You have to pay to get out of
 Going through all these things twice
 Oh Mama
 Can this really be th end
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 With the Memphis blus again.</lyrics>
