.G                   D                       Em
 Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
.G                      D          Em
 Gotta compete with the wily Japanese.
.        G                   D
 There's too many home fires burning
.               Em
 And not enough trees,
.   G
 So fuck all that
.      D                        Em
 We've got to get on with these.

 Can't stop       Lose job    Mind gone   Silicon
 What bomb        Get away    Pay day     Make hay
 Break down       Need fix    Big six
.                                                        G     D Em
 Clickity click   Hold on     Oh no       Brrrrrrrrrring bingo!

.C/E               Em              D/E                          Em
 Make 'em laugh.   Make 'em cry.   Make 'em dance in the aisles.
.C/E               Em              D/E           Em
 Make 'em pay.     Make 'em stay.  Make'em feel ok.

 Not nah John
.      D                      Em        G
 We've got to get on with the film show.
.          D                       Em
 Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow.
.G                    D
 Who cares what it's about
.               Em
 As long as the kids go.
.G
 Not now John
.D                      Asus
 Got to get on with the show.

.G                  D                       Em
 Hang on John we've got to get on with this.
.  G
 I don't know what it is
.       D                  Em
 But it fits on here like.....
.G                      D
 Come at the end of the shift,
.                 Em
 We'll go and get pissed.
.    G
 But now now John
.     D
 I've got to get on with this.

.C/E
 Hold on John
.                Em
 I think there's something good on.
.  D/E                     Em
 I used to read books but.....
.   C/E
 It could be the news,
.        Em
 Or some other abuse,
.      D/E               Em
 Or it could be reusable shows.

.G                   D                       Em
 Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
.G                         D        Em
 Got to compete with the wily Japanese.
.G                 D               Em
 No need to worry about the Vietnamese.
.G                         D            Em
 Got to bring the Russian bear to his knees.
.      G                     D
 Well, maybe not the Russian bear,
.          Em
 Maybe the Swedes.
.   G
 We showed Argentina
.    D                    Em
 Now let's go and show these.
.G
 Make us feel tough
.    D                  Em
 And wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
.G                              D  Em
