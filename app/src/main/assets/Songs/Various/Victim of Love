;from Into the Fire (A&amp;M)
;VERSE:
.F
 Livin' on your own can be a lonely game
.  C
 A face in the crown, no one knows your name
.       Bb                                    Am7
 It's a table for one and a broken heart to go
.F
 She's the kind of lover that you always dreamed
.      C
 would come to stay and never wanna leave
.    Bb                                            Am7
 But that's all changed; she's dealt the final blow

;CHORUS:
.G
 Heaven knows what you were thinkin of
.      Dm                            Bb            C
 Don't blame yourself, you're just a victim of love

;VERSE:
 It doesn't matter who was right or wrong
 When the fire is over, when the magic's gone
 You pick up the pieces, and do the best you can
 It knocks you down, but you try it again
 You get a little older, it's a cryin' shame
 Sometimes things don't work out like you plan

.G
 Who's gonna help you when you've had enough
.   Dm                       Bb            C
 It ain't no secret you're a victim of love
.G
 Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
.      Dm                            Bb
 Don't blame yourself, you're just a victim of love

;VERSE:
 One goodbye was really all it took
 Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book
 But somehow all the numbers look the same
 You've been thinkin' how to get around it
 But there ain't nothin' you can do about it
 Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained

;CHORUS:
 Ain't nothin's you can do about it
 Call it what you want but you're a victim of love
 Who's gonna help you when you've had enough
 Ain't no secret you're a victim of love
