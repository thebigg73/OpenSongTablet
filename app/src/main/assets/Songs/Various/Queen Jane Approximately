.          Dm9    Em                     F   C
 When your mother sends back all of your invitations
.         Dm9            Em         F G7
 And your father to your sister, he explains
.            C            F                       C     Am
 That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
.C              F            C   F
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane
.C              F            C
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane

 Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
 And the smell of their roses does not remain
 And all of your children start to resent you
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane

 Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
 Have died in battle or in vain
 And you're sick of all this repetition
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane

 When all of your advisors heave their plastic
 At your feet to convince you of your pain
 Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane

 Now when all the other bandits that you turned the other cheek to
 All lay down their bandanas and complain
 And you want somebody you don't have to speak to
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane
 Won't you come see me Queen Jane</lyrics>
