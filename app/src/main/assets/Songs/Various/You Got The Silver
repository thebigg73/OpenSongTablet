.Bb        F7  Bb
 Hey babe,    what's in your eyes
.F7             Bb                 F7
 I saw them flashing like airplane lights
.Bb                    F7
 You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
.                Bb                     Bb       Bbdim       F7         Bb          Fdim
 But I must come back for a little more                                             

.F7         Bb                F7
 You got my heart, you got my soul
.            Bb                 F7
 You got the silver, you got the gold
.            Bb                F7
 You got the diamonds from the mines
.              Bb                   Cm7          Ab/C         Cm/F
 And that's allright it'll buy some time                      

.F7      Bb    F7            Bb
 Tell me honey   what will I do
.F7      Bb                 F7
 When I am hungry and thirsty too
.        Bb                      F7
 Feeling fooling, and that's for sure
.             Bb                           Bb       Bdim       F7        Bb       F7      Bb7
 Just waiting here at your kitchen door                                                   

.    Eb                   Bb
 Hey baby, what's in your eyes
.            Eb                Bb
 Is that the diamonds from the mines
.            Eb               Bb
 What's that laughing in your smile
.        Eb        Edim         F7
 I don't care, no,      I don't care

.F7  Bb
 Oh, baby, you got the soul
.            Eb                  Bb
 You got the silver, you got the gold
.           Eb                Bb
 A flash of love just made me blind
.        Eb      Edim                          F7          Cm9            F13
 I don't care, no        that's no big surprise</lyrics>
