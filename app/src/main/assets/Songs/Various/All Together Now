.F                      C7
 One, two, three, four, can I have a little more?
.F                              C7          F
 Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you.
.F           C7
 A, B, C, D, can I bring a friend to tea?
.F                 C7     F
 E, F, G, H, I, J, I love you.

.F              Bb                         F
 Bom, bom, bom, bom-pa-bom, sail the ship, bom-pa-bom, chop the tree.
.Bb                         C7
 Bom-pa-bom, skip the rope, bom-pa-bom, look at me.

.F                                   C7                F
 All together now, all together now, all together now, all together now...</lyrics>
