;Kurt Cobain
;As interpreted by Rick Scaia (ag725@freenet.carleton.ca)
;The primary riff for this tune is just an F power chord (for two quarter
;notes) then a quick slide down to a heavily muted E power chord (two
;eighths and a quarter note).  If you've heard the song, it's pretty
;easy.  The chorus and solo aren't much more difficult.
[Intro]	F  E  F  E

;Verse:
.F     E               F
 Hello toilet trained, come on in
.F       E         F
 Floyd observes my hairy chin
.F         E                   F
 "Sit down in the chair, don't be afraid."
.F            E     F     E
 Steaming hot towel on my face

;Chorus:
[C]
.C#    A     C     G#
                       I was
.C#    A     C     G#
 sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-ved,  I'm
.C#    A     C     G#
 asha-a-a-a-a-a-a-med, I was
.C#    A     C     G#
 sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-ved,  I'm
.C#    A     C     G#
 asha-a-a-a-a-a-a-med

;Main riff twice

;Verse 2:
 Something indecipherable in the room
 Opie, Aunt Bea, I presume
 They take turns and cut me up
 I die smothered, Andy's not

;Chorus

;Solo:

;Main riff twice

;Chorus

;Main riff once, then bass only on main riff, then drums only.
;If you're just playing alone, just play it three time, and mute
;it more each time until the third time is extremely percussive sounding.</lyrics>
