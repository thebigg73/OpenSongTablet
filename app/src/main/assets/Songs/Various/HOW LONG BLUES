.    E               E7
 How  long, baby how  long,
.         A                   A7
 Has that  evening train been  gone?
.    E              B7              E      E
 How  long, how how  long, baby how  long? 

.            E                       E7
 Went to the  station, didn't see no  train.
.           A                        A7
 Down in my  heart, I have an aching  pain.
.    E              B7              E      E
 How  long, how how  long, baby how  long? 

.          E                 E7
 I feel disgusted, I feel so  bad
.                   A                          A7
 Thinking 'bout the  good time that I once had  had.
.    E              B7              E      E
 How  long, how how  long, baby how  long? 

.                E                           E7
 I could see the  green grass growing on the  hill;
.                A                      A7
 I ain't seen no  greenback on a dollar  bill.
.    E              B7              E      E
 How  long, how how  long, baby how  long? 

.                E                  E7
 You're gonna be  sorry you feel so  blue.
.              A                                 A7
 When you want  me, baby, I declare I want, want  you.
.    E              B7              E      E
 How  long, how how  long, baby how  long?

 Don't have no  money for to ride the  train.
