   I wanna love you

 and treat you right.

 I wanna love you

 with a roof right over our heads.
.      C#m       F#m    F#m
 We'll share the shelter
.D            A
 of my single bed.
.      C#m       F#m       F#m
 We'll share the same room,
.D               A
 Jah provide the bread.

 Is this love, is this love, is this love,
.                      Bm      Bm
 is this love that I'm feeling?
.        C#m                         C#m
 Is this love, is this love, is this love,
.                      Bm      Bm
 is this love that I'm feeling?
