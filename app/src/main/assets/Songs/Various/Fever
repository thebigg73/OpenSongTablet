.Am
  Never know how much I love you,
 Never know how much I care.
 When you put your arms around me
.        E7                      Am
 I get a Fever that's so hard to bear.

.N.C.               Am
 You give me Fever,  when you kiss me
.F6                     Am
 Fever when you hold me tight
 Fever - in the morning
.          E7          Am
 Fever all through the night

 Sun lights up the daytime,
 Moon lights up the night.
 I light up when you call my name
 And you know I'm gonna treat you right.

 You give me Fever, when you kiss me
 Fever when you hold me tight
 Fever - in the morning
 Fever all through the night

.Am
  Ev'rybody's got the Fever
 That is something you all know
 Fever isn't such a new thing
.E7                   Am
 Fever started long a-go

 Romeo loved Juliet,
 Juliet she felt the same.
 When he pout his arms around her, he said,
 "Julie, baby, you're my flame."

 Thou givest Fever, when we kisseth
 Fever when thy flaming youth.
 Fever - I'm a fire
 Fever, yea I burn forsooth.

 Captain Smith and Pocahantas
 Had a very mad affair
 When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said,
 "Daddy-o don't you dare."

 He gives me Fever, with his kisses
 Fever when he holds me tight
 Fever - I'm his Missus
 Oh Daddy won't you treat him right

 Now you've listened to my story
 Here's a point that I have made.
 Chicks were born to give you Fever
 Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

 They give you fever, when you kiss them
 Fever if you live and learn.
 Fever - 'til you sizzle
 What a lovely way to burn
 What a lovely way to burn
 What a lovely way to burn</lyrics>
