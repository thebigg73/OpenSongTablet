.Am   F   Am   F
               
.Am                              F
 Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
.Am                             F
 enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
.Am                          F
 She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
.Am                            F
 Cries out "My God they killed them all!"
.C                           F
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
.C                          F
 The man the authorities came to blame
.Dm                          C
 for something that he never done
.Dm                       C
 Put in a prison cell but one time
.Em                Am   F                   C  G  Am  F  Am  F
 he could have been the champion of the world                

 Three bodied lying there does Patty see
 and another man named Bello moving mysteriously
 "I didn't do it" he says, and he throws up his hands
 "I was only robbin the register, I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin," he says and he stops
 One of us had better call the cops
 so Patty calls the cops
 and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin
 in the hot New Jersey night

 Meanwhile somewhere in another part of town
 Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
 number one contender for the middleweight crown
 had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
 when a cop pulled him over on the side of the road
 just like the time before and the time before that
 in Paterson that just the ways things go
 If you black you might as well not show up on the streets
 Less you wanna draw the heat

 Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
 Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin around
 He said "I saw two men runnin out, they looked like middleweights
 They jumped into a white car with out of state plates"
 And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
 Cop said "Wait a minute boys, this one's not dead"
 so they took him to the infirmary
 and although this man could hardly see
 they told him that he could identify the guilty men

 Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
 Take him to the hospital and bring him upstairs
 the wounded man looks up though his one dying eye
 says "why'd you bring him here for? he ain't the guy!"
 Yes, here the story of the Hurricane
 The man the authorities came to blame
 for something that he never done
 put in a prison cell but one time he could've been
 the champion of the world

 Four months later the ghetto's in flame
 Rubin's in South America fightin for his name
 while Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
 and the cops are puttin the screw to him looking for somebody to blame
 "Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
 "Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
 "You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
 "Think it might have been that fighter that you saw running that night?"
 "Don't forget that you are white"

 Arthur Dexter Bradley said "I'm really not sure"
 Cops said "A poor boy like you could really use a break
 We got you for the motel job and were talking to your friend Bello
 Now you don't want to ave to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
 You'll be doin' society a favor
 That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver
 We want to put his ass in the stir
 We want to pin this trip murder on him
 He ain't ne Gentleman Jim"

 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
 he never did like to talk about it all that much
 It's my work he'd say, I do it for pay
 and when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 up to some paradise
 where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
 and ride a horse along a trail
 but then they took him to the jail house
 where they try to make a man into a mouse

 All of Rubin's card were marked in advance
 The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
 the judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
 to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
 but to the black folks he was a crazy nigger
 no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
 and though they could not produce the gun
 the D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
 And the all-white jury agreed

 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
 the crime was murder "one", guess who testified?
 Bello and Bradley and the both badly lied
 and the newspapers all went along for the ride
 how can the life of such a man
 be in the palm of some fool's hand?
 to see him obviously framed
 couldn't help but be ashamed to live in a land
 where justice is a game

 Now all the criminal in their coats and their ties
 are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
 while Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten foot cell
 and innocent man in a living hell
 that's the story of the Hurricane
 but it won't be over till they clear him name
 and give him back the time he's done
 put in a prison cell but one time he could've been
 the champion of the world.</lyrics>
