.A D G E A D G E
               
.A D G E A D G E D
                 

.                  A         F#m             E   D
 I think about her all the time, she's my fantasy
.                  A        F#m              E D
 An image burning in my mind, calling out to me
.               A                      Bm7
 While my imagination's running wild, yeah
.                     E      Bm7
 Things are getting clearer, oh

;CHORUS:
.A     D
 This time
.   G           E
 Everything is all right
.A   D         G          E
 No way she's gonna get away
.A     D       G         E
 This time everything is easy
.A    D G                     E
 Any day I'm gonna make her mine

 I thought of every word I'd say, give or take a few
 But she turns and slowly walks away, what do I have to do?
 Hey turn up your radio, oh
 There's something I want you to know, yeah

;Chorus

.      F#m                       E
 It's hard to take, cause she's miles away
.          F#m           E
 And I've waited a long time
.         F#m
 But the feeling is right
.         E                Bm7
 Darling one of these nights, yeah
.                   E
 I'm gonna let you know, oh

;Chorus
