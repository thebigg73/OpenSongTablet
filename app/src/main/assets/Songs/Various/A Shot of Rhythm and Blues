.              D
 Well, if your hands start a'clappin' and your fingers start a'poppin' and your feet start a'movin' around.
.           G7                                                     D
 And if you start to swing and sway when the band starts to play a real cool way out sound.
.           A7                           G7
 And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
.    A7                        G7
 You feel like you gotta move around.

.G7
 You get a shot of Rhythm and Blues.
.                            D
 With just a little Rock and Roll on the side, just for good measure.
.G7
 Get a pair of dancin' shoes.
.                              A7
 Well, with your lover by your side don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!

.          D                          G7
 Don't you worry 'bout a thing if you start to dance and sing
.    D
 And chills comin' up on you.
.           G7
 And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
.      A7                          D
 Well, here's something for you to do.

 Get a shot of Rhythm and Blues.
 With just a little Rock and Roll on the side, just for good measure.
 Get a pair of dancin' shoes.
 Well, with your lover by your side don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!

 And chills comin' up on you.
 And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
 Well, here's something for you to do.
