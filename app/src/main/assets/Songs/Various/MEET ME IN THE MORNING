 By the time the snow begins to thaw                      

 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
 They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
 Honey you wouldn't know it by me
 Every day's been darkness since you've been gone

 Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
 Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
 Well I feel just like that rooster
 Honey you treat me so unkind

 Well I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fire from above
 Well I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fire from above
 Well you know I even outrun the hound dog
 Honey you know I earned your love

 Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
 Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
 Ain't that just like my heart babe
 When you kiss my lips</lyrics>
