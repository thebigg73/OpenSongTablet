 There's rain on my window, but I'm thinking of you          
.Dm                                   Gm         Gm7/C C
 Tears on my pillow, but I will come through

.        Dm                                  Gm7
 In the coldest of winters the night becomes day

 Josephine, I'll send you all my love
.                        G7                  Gm
 and every single step I take, I'll take for you
