.     Dm        Bb      C           Am7
 This circus is falling down on its knees
.    Dm         F         C      Am
 The big top is crumbling down   
.     Dm         Bb        C           Am7
 It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
.          Dm         Bb        C       Am
 Where you should be, no one's around   

.         Bb
 I need a phone call
.         Bb
 I need a raincoat
.         Bb
 I need a big love
.         Bb
 I need a phone call

 These train conversations are passing me by
 And I don't have nothing to say
 You get what you pay for
 But I just had no intention of living this way

 I need a phone call
 I need a plane ride
 I need a sunburn
 I need a raincoat

.C            Bb
 And I get no answers
.C                  Bb
 And I don't get no change
.C               Bb         F
 It's raining in Baltimore, baby
.C              F           C
 But everything else is the same

 There's things I remember and things I forget
 I miss you   I guess that I should
 Three thousand five hundred miles away
 But what would you change if you could?

 I need a phone call   Maybe I should buy a new car
 I can always hear a freight train   If I listen real hard
 And I wish it was a small world
 Because I'm lonely for the big towns
 I'd like to hear a little guitar
 I think it's time to put the top down

 I need a phone call
 I need a raincoat</lyrics>
