 Ooo, you make me live now honey
 Ooo, you make me live

 You're the first one
 When things turn out bad
 You know I'll never be lonely
 You're my only one
 And I love
 The things that you do
 You're my best friend

 Ooo, you make me live

 I'm happy, happy at home
 You're my best friend
 You're my best friend
 Ooo, you make me live
 You, you're my best friend</lyrics>
