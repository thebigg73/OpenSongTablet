;Counting Crows

;Intro:
.F#m          E           F#m          D
                                       

.F#m                    C#m
      Start tearing the old man down
.    E                    Bm                  F#m
 Run past the heather and down to the old road
.                  C#m                  D
 Start turning the grain into the ground
.                      F#m
 Roll a new leaf over  
.       C#m                            E
 In the middle of the night there's an old man
.          Bm
 Treading around in the gathered rain
.F#m                       C#m          E
 Hey mister if you want to walk on water
.                         A
 Would you drop a line my way

;Chorus:
.   E        F#m
 Omaha       
.             D
 Somewhere in middle America
.A                E                 D
 Get right to the heart of matters  
.                            A         E
 It's the heart that matters more      
.                     F#m              B              D
 I think you'd better turn your ticket in             
.                                  A                  D
 And leave your money right at the door               

.A            D
              

;Verse 2:
 Start threading the needle
 Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
 Start turning the wool across the wire
 Roll the new life over
 In the middle of the night there's an old man
 Threading his toes through a bucket of rain
 Hey mister if you want to walk on water
 You're only going to walk all over me
.Chorus

;Verse 3:
 Start running the banner down
 Drop past the color come up through the summer rain
 Start turning the girl into the ground
 Roll a new life over
 In the middle of the night there's a young man
 Rolling around in the earth and rain
 Hey mister if you're going to walk on water, you know
 You're only going to walk all over me
