.              A                      D7          A
 Well she was just seventeen, if you know what I mean
.                                          E7
 And the way she looked was way beyond compare,
.    A           A7          D       F          A        E7       A
 So how could I dance with another,     when I saw her standing there.

.      A                    D7        A
 Well she looked at me, and I, I could see,
.                                           E7
 That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
. A            A7          D       F          A       E7       A
 She wouldn't dance with another,     when I saw her standing there.

.         D7
 Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room,
.                        E
 And I held her hand in mine...

.          A                               D7              A
 Well we danced through the night, and we held each other tight,
.                                         E7
 And before too long I fell in love with her.
.     A          A7          D       F           A        E7       A
 Now I'll never dance with another,     since I saw her standing there.

 Instrumental same as verse

.         D7
 Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room,
.                        E
 And I held her hand in mine...

.          A                               D7              A
 Well we danced through the night, and we held each other tight,
.                                         E7
 And before too long I fell in love with her.
.     A          A7          D       F           A        E7       A
 Now I'll never dance with another,     since I saw her standing there.
.         A        E7       A
 Since I saw her standing there.
.         A        E7       A
 Since I saw her standing there.</lyrics>
