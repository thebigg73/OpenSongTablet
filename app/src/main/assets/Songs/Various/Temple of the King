;Intro: 	Am  F | G  Am | Am  G | Dm/F Am

.C              G
 One day in the year of the fox
.       Dm              Am
 Came a time remembered well
.         F
 When the strong young man
.       G
 Of the rising sun heard the
.Am
 Tolling of the great black bell

.C              G
 One day in the year of the fox when the
.E             Am
 Bell began to ring, it meant the
.F                     G
 Time had come for the one to go to the
.Am
 Temple of the King

.Dm
 There in the middle of the circle, he stands
.Am
 Searching, Seeking,
.      G
 With just one touch of his trembling hand
.     Am
 The answer will be found

.Dm
 Daylight waits for the oldman's scream
.Am
 Heaven, help me,
.G                   Dm
 Just like a rush of thousand wings
.   E
 It shines upon the world
.        F       G      Am
 And the day has just begun

;Repeat intro

.C              G
 One day in the year of the fox
.       Dm              Am
 Came a time remembered well
.         F
 When the strong young man
.       G
 Of the rising sun heard the

 Tolling of the great black bell

 One day in the year of the fox when the

 Bell began to ring, it meant the
.F                     G
 Time had come for the one to go to the
.Am
 Temple of the King

.Dm
 There in the middle of people he stands
.Am
 Seeking, feeling
.         G
 Just one touch of the strong right hand
.     E
 He's gone, to the
.F      G      Am
 Temple of the King

;Repeat intro

;Solo over:  Am / F / Am / F / Am G / Dm / E / Am / F / Am / F Am / G / Dm / E

.Dm
 Far from the circle of the edge of the world
.      Am
 He's smoking, wandering
.G
 Thinking back of the stories he's told
.       Am
 Before he's gonna see
.Dm
 There in the middle of the circle he lies
.Am
 Heaven, help me
.G                    Dm
 All could see by the shine in his eyes
.    E
 The answer has been found

.Dm
 Back with the people in the circle he stands
.Am
 Seeing, feeling
.     G                    Dm                     E
 With just one touch of the strong right hand they know
.       F      G       Am
 Of the Temple and the King
