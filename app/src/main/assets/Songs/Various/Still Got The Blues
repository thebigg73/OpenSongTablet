;Intro
.Dm7   F/G   Cmaj7 Fmaj7 Bm7b5 E     Am
                                     

.Dm7           F/G  Cmaj7             Fmaj7
 Used to be so easy to give my heart away
.Bm7b5                        E   Am   Bmadd4         Am/C      Am
 But I've found that the hard way is a price you have to pay    
.Dm7          F/G  Cmaj7            Fmaj7
 I found that love was no friend of mine
 Bm7b5               Esus4      E
.Bm7b5               Esus4      E
 I should have known time after time

[C
.Am Em           Am      Dadd2
 So long, it was so long ago
.         F7/9          E7#9      Am
 But I've still got the blues for you
[

 Used to be so easy to fall in love again
 I've found that the hard way, it's a way that leads to pain
 I've found that love was more than just a game
 To play and to win but to lose just the same

[C
 So long, it was so long ago
 But I've still got the blues for you
[

.Bm7     E     Am7        Bm7       C
 So many years since I've seen your face
.Bm7           E                 Fmaj7 Cadd2    Fmaj7
 And now in my heart, there's an empty space    
.            Am
 You used to be

.Am Em           Am      Dadd9
 So long, it was so long ago
.         F7/9                    Am     Em
 But I've still got the blues for you    
.           Am            Em          Am          Dadd9
 Though the days come and go, there's one thing I know
.     F7/9          E7#9      Am
 I've still got the blues for you</lyrics>
