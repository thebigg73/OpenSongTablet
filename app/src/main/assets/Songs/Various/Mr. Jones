.C              F
 Smiling in the bright lights
.G
 Comming through in sterio
.C              F          G
 When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

 I will paint my picture   Paint my self in blue and red and black and grey

 We all want to be big big stars, but we got diffrent reasons for that.

 Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky

 When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be.

.C    F           G
 Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
.C         F                    G
 When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
.C                 F                    G
 We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
.C                  F           G
 But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be.
.C         F           G
 Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....</lyrics>
