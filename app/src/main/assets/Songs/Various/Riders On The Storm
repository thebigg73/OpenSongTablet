.Em            A       Em     A
 Riders on the storm          
.Em            A       Em     A
 Riders on the storm          
.  Am                  B/A    C/A      D/A
 Into this house we're born            
.  Em                   A       Em   A
 Into this world we're thrown        
.     D
 Like dog without a bone
.    C
 An actor out on loan
.Em             A     Em7    A
 Riders on the storm         

.          Em         A       Em7    A
 There's a killer on the road        
.             Em             A      Em7   A
 His brain is squirming like a toad       
.     Am         Bm/A  C/A     D/A
 Take a long holiday           
.Em             A      Em7   A
 Let your children play      
.       D
 If you give this man a ride
.      C
 Sweet family will die
.Em         A      Em7   A
 Killer on the road

.Em         A       Em7   A
 Gotta love your man      
.          Em         A       Em7   A
 Girl, you gotta love your man      
.Am              Bm/A    C/A     D/A
 Take him by the hand            
.Em       A          Em7    A
 Make him understand        
.    D
 The world on you depends
.    C
 Our life will never end
.    Em         A       Em7    A
 You gotta love your man
