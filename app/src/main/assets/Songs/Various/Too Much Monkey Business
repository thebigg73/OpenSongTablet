 Runnin' to-and-fro, hard.  Workin' at the mail.
.      A7
 Never fail.  Get the mail.  Yeah, some rotten deal,  Ow!
.D7                          A
    Too much monkey business.  Too much monkey business.
.E7                           D7               A     E7
 Too much monkey business for me to invite 'em again.

 Say me.  Talkin' to me.  Tryin' to run me up a creek.
 She used to buy one.  Try to pay me again next week,  Ow!
 Too much monkey business.  Too much monkey business.
 Too much monkey business for me to invite 'em again.

 Long-haired, good-lookin'.  Tryin' to get me hooked.
 Or me to marry.  Settle down.  Get the horn by the bull,  Ow!
 Too much monkey business.  Too much monkey business.
 Too much monkey business for me to invite 'em again.

 Mediocre money.  Bein' fightin' in the hall.
 Army bunk,  Army go,  Army chow,  Army cook,  Ow!
 Too much monkey business.  Too much monkey business.
 Too much monkey business for me to invite 'em again.

 Same thing every day.  Gettin' up, goin' to school.
 No need to make complainin'.  My objection's overruled,  Ow!
 Too much monkey business.  Too much monkey business.
 Too much monkey business for me to invite 'em again.

 Workin' in the fillin' station.  Too many tires.
 Wipe the windows.  Check the tire.  Check the oil and all the gas,  Ow!
 Too much monkey business.  Too much monkey business.
 Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me.</lyrics>
