.     G                                  Am
 They flutter behind you your possible pasts,
.     C                          D              G
 Some brighteyed and crazy, some frightened and lost.
.  G                              Am
 A warning to anyone still in command
.C                 D               G
 Of their possible future, to take care.
.   G                                 Am
 In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
.     C                      D                 G
 With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time.
.Em
 Do you remember me, how we used to be,
.                         D
 Do you think we shoud be closer?

.    G                                       Am
 She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile
.C                        D           G
 Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign.
.    G                                     Am
 Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
.        C                         D               G
 For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs.
.G                                   Am
 Stepping up boldly one put out his hand.
.          C                      D                G
 He said, "I was just a child then, now I'm only a man."
.Em
 Do you remember me,  how we used to be,
.                          D
 Do you think we should be closer?

.Em  C  Em  C  Em  D  C  D  Cmaj9
                            

.       G                                    Am
 By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
.      C                    D            G
 Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad.
.G                                      Am
 Strung out behind us the banners and flags
.       C                     D           G
 Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags.
.Em
 Do you remember me, how we used to be,
.                          D
 Do you think we should be closer?</lyrics>
