;Intro: Am - F - C - G (and repeat and repeat...)

.Am       F     C G
 I am the passenger and I ride and I ride,
 I ride through the city's backsides
 I see the stars come out of the sky,
 yeah the bright and hollow sky
 you know it looks so good tonight

 I am the passenger, I stay under glass,
 I look through my window so bright
 I see the stars come out tonight
 I see the bright and hollow sky
 over the city's ripped backside
 and everything looks good tonight.

;Chorus
 Singing la la la la la la la la... (3x)
 La la

 Get into the car, we'll be the passenger,
 we'll ride through the city tonight,
 we'll see the city's ripped backsides,
 we'll see the bright and hollow sky
 we'll see the stars that shine
 so bright stars made for us tonight

 O the passenger, how how he rides
 O the passenger, he rides and he rides
 He looks through his window, what does he see ?
 He sees the sign and hollow sky
 He sees the stars come out tonight
 He sees the city's ripped backsides
 He sees the winding ocean drive
 and everything was made for you and me
 all of it was made for you and me 'cause it
 just belongs to you and me
 so let's take a ride and see what's mine...

;Chorus

 O the passenger, he rides and he rides
 he sees things from under glass
 he looks through his window side
 he sees the things he knows are his
 he sees the bright and hollow sky
 he sees the city sleep at night
 he sees the stars are out tonight
 and all of it is yours and mine
 and all of it is yours and mine
 so let's ride and ride and ride and ride...

;Chorus</lyrics>
