.Bb        Ab          Eb           Bb
 I married Isis on the fifth day of May
.                     Ab       Eb        Bb
 But I could not hold on to her very long
.                Ab           Eb            Bb
 So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
.                      Ab              Eb           Bb
 For the wild unkown country where I could not go wrong

 I came to a high place of darkness and light
 The dividing line ran through the centre of town
 So I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
 Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down

 A man in the corner approached me for a match
 I knew right away he was not ordinary
 He said "Are you lookin' for something easy to catch?"
 I said "I ain't got no money",He said "That ain't necessary".

 We set out that night for the cold in the North.
 I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word
 I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
 I said "That's the best news I ever heard."

 I was thinking about turquiose I was thinking about gold.
 I was thhinking about diamonds and the worlds biggest necklace.
 As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
 I was thinking about Isis, how sh thought I was so reckless.

 How she told me that one day we'd meet up again,
 And thing would be different the next time we wed.
 If I only hang on and just be her friend.
 I still can't remember all the best things she said.

 We came to the pyramids all embedde in ice.
 He said "There's a body I'm trying to find,
 If I carry it out it'll fetch a good price."
 Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.

 The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous.
 We chopped throught he night and we chopped throught he dawn.
 When he died I was hopong that it wasn't contagious,
 But I made up my mind that I had to go on.

 I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
 There were no jewels no nothing, I felt I'd been had.
 When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
 When I took up his offer I must-a been mad

 I picked up his body and I dragged it inside,
 Threw down into the hole and I put back the cover.
 I said a quick prayer and I felt satified
 Then I rode back to Isis just to tell her I love her.

 She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
 Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
 I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.
 I cursed one time then rode on ahead.

 She said "Where ya been?" I said "No place special."
 She said "You look different." I said "Well I guess."
 She said "You been gone." I said "That's only natural."
 She said "You gonna stay." I said "Well if you want me to yes."

 Isis oh Isis you're a mystical child
 What drives me to you is what drives me insane
 I still can remember the way that you smiled
 On the fifth day of May in the drizziling rain.</lyrics>
