.        D            G             D
 I went down to the place where I knew she lay waiting
.           G               A
 Under the marble and the snow
.        D           G              D
 I said Mother I'm frightened the thunder and the lightning
.                   G           A
 I'll never come through this alone
.     G            C            G              C
 She said I'll be with you my shawl wrapped around you
.    G            C             G
 My hand on your head when you go
.         D                    Am           F                     C
 And the night came on it was very calm, I wanted the night to go on and on
.         G                             D  G D
 But she said go back, go back to the world

.         D          G                D
 We were fighting in Egypt when they signed this agreement
.             G           A
 That nobody else had to die
.                D         G           D
 There was this terrible sound and my father went down
.                  G           A
 With a terrible wound in his side
.         G        C            G            C
 He said try to go on take my books take my gun
.   G         C            G
 Remember my son how they lied
.         D                   Am
 And the night comes on it's very calm
.     F                       C
 I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
.         G                              D  G D
 But you don't want to lie, not to the young

.         D              G         D
 We were locked in this kitchen I took to religion
.                    G               A
 And I wondered how long she would stay
.   D         G            D                                   G          A
 I needed so much to have nothing to touch, I've always been greedy that way
.        G           C               G          C
 But my son and my daughter climbed out of the water
.        G         C           G
 Crying Papa you promised to play
.          D                    Am
 And they lead me away to the great surprise
.      F                     C
 It's Papa don't peek, Papa cover your eyes
.          G                       D  G D
 And they hide, they hide in the world

.       D           G           D
 Now I look for her always I'm lost in this calling
.                   G              A
 I'm tied to the threads of some prayer
.         D            G          D
 Saying when will she summon me when will she come to me
.             G        A
 What must I do to prepare
.          G           C              G              C
 When she bends to my longing like a willow like a fountain
.      G            C        G
 She stands in the luminous air
.         D                   Am
 And the night comes on it's very calm
.   F                    C
 I lie in her arms, she says when I'm gone
.          G                 D  G D
 I'll be yours, yours for a song

.          D           G            D
 Now the crickets are singing, the vesper bells ringing
.                    G            A
 The cat's curled asleep in his chair
.         D              G          D
 I'll go down to Bill's Bar, I can make it that far
.                      G                A
 And I'll see if my friends are still there
.         G             C          G             C
 Yes and here's to the few who forgive what you do
.         G         C          G
 And the fewer who don't even care
.         D                    Am
 And the night comes on, it's very calm
.   F                    C
 I want to cross over I want to go home
.         G                             D  G D
 But she says go back, go back to the world
