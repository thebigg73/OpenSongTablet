.F

.A#
 Somebody told me
.          G#
 Just the other day
.              D#
 That you're leaving me
.        F
 We're through

 Well if you knew
 How it hurt me so
 Then you'd changed your mind
 I'm sure
 Don't want to hear
 What's going on
 I don't care
 What's new

.A#
 Don't want to know
.        G#
 About anything
.      D#    A#
 'Cos all I want
.    D#
 Is you

. Cm                   G
 Going out with other girls
. Cm                A#
 Was always such a bore
. Cm                  G#
 But since I fell in love with you
.   D#                F
 I need you more and more

 Don't want to know
 About one-night-stands
 Cut-price souvenirs
 All I want is
 The real thing
 And a night that lasts
 For years.

 If you ever change your mind
 I've a certain cure
 An old refrain, it lingers on
 L'amour, toujours l'amour...

 Don't want to learn
 About etiquette
 From glossy magazines
 Why should I try
 To talk correct
 Like they do
 In other scenes
 Say no more about imagery
 You're starting to confuse
 Just make an offer
 Of more romance
 Of course I can't refuse
 All I want is you
 Oo oo I'm all cracked up on you.</lyrics>
