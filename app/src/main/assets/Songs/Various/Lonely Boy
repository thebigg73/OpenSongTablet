 He was born on a summerday nineteen-fifty-one
 And with the slap of a hand he had landed as an only son
 His mother and father said what a lovely boy
 W'll teach him what we've learned, oh yes, just what we've learned
 We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school
 It'll teach him how to fight to be nobody's fool

;chorus

 In the summer of fifty-three his mother brought him a sister
 And she told him "We must attend to her needs, she's so much younger than you"
 Well, he ran down the hall and he cried
 Oh, how could his parents have lied
 When they said he was their only son
 He thought he was their only one

;chorus

;solo - bridge
;then guitar
 Goodbye mama, goodbye youth
 Goodbye papa, I'm pushing on through, ohoh
;piano (slow), theb +bas, +guitar, back to intro

 He left home on a winterday nineteen-sixty-nine
 And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time
 Well, his sister grew up and she married a man
 He gave her a son, oh yes, a lovely son
 They dressed him up warmly, they sent him to school
 They taught him how to fight to be nobody's fool

;chorus
 - Ohoh -
