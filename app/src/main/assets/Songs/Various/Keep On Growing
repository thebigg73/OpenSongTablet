 I was  laughing,
.D/A                              A
  Laying in the streets, I wasn't  knowing;
.  G       D     A
 I  didn't  know  my fate.

  Playing
.    D/A                             A
 The  game of love, but never really  showing
.    G             D         A
 The  thought that  love was  great.

.E                      D           A
  I was a young man and  sure to go  astray.
.E                                  D                          F#m
  You walked right into my life and  told me love would find a 
.    E
 way 
.           A         D        A         D        A         D
 To keep on  growing,  keep on  growing,  keep on  growing.

 I was  standing,
.D/A                             A
  Looking in the face of one who  loved me,
.G        D   A
  Feeling  so  ashamed.
.A
  Hoping,
.    D/A                                 A
 And  praying, Lord, that she could understand me,
.      G       D         A
 But I  didn't  know her  name.

.E                             D              A
  She took my hand in hers and  told me I was  wrong.
.E                                         D           F#m   E
  She said, you're gonna be all right boy,  oh just as  long 
.               A         D        A         D        A
 As you keep on  growing,  keep on  growing,  keep on 
.         D
 growing. 
.G      D      A
  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

  Lady,
.D/A                                A
  Someday, baby, who knows where or  when, Lord,
.G         D         A
  Just you  wait and  see.
.         A
 We'll be  walking,
.  D/A                           A
 Together hand in hand along the  way, love.
.G          D      A
  Hope it's  still  me.

.E                   D                       A
  This time is gonna  change us, Lord, and I  know it's true;

 Keep on  growing,  keep on  growing,  keep on  growing.
