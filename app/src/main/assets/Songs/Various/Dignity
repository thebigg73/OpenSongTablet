.D
 Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
 Thin man lookin' at his last meal
.G                               D
 Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
.                G  D
 For dig-ni-ty      

.D
 Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
 young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
.G                                D
 poor man lookin' through painted glass
.            G  D
 For dignity    

.A
 Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
.G                             D
 Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
.G                     F#m
 I went into the city, went into the town
.Em                                           A
 went into the land of the midnight sun       

.D
 Searchin' high, searchin' low
 Searchin' everywhere I know
.G
 Askin' the cops wherever I go
.                         G  D
 Have you seen Dignity?      

 Blind man breakin' out of a trance
 Puts both his hands in the pocket of chance
 Hopin' to find one circumstance
 Of dignity

 I went to the wedding of Mary-lou
 She said " I don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
 Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
 About dignity

 I went down where the vultures feed
 I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
 Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
 Wasn't any difference to me

 Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
 House on fire, debts unpaid
 Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
 Have you seen dignity

 Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
 In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
 Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
 For Dignity

 Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
 Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
 He wanted money up front, said he was abused
 By dignity

 Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand
 Steps goin' down into tatoo land
 I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
 In the bordertowns of despair

 Got no place to fade, got no coat
 I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
 Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
 About dignity

 Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
 Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
 And into every masterpiece of literature
 For dignity

 Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
 Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
 Bites the bullet and he looks within
 For dignity

 Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
 Dignity never been photographed
 I went into the red, went into the black
 Into the valley of dry bone dreams

 So many roads, So much at stake
 So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
 Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
 To find dignity</lyrics>
