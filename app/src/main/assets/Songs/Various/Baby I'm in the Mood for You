.G
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna milk my milk cow low
.C                                                   G
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna leave my lonesome home
.G                                 B7               C
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna hit that highway road
.         G         D            G     C
 But then again and again I said oh oh oh
.G      D                    G
 Oh Babe I'm in the mood for you

 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna turn my back to the wall
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna live in my pony stall
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I ain't gonna do nothin at all
 But then again and again I said oh I said oh I said
 Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you

 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change the things in the town
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change the whole world around
 But then again and again I said oh I said oh I said
 Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you

 Sometimes I'm in the mood I'm gonna give away all my sins
 Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna walk the road again
 Sometimes I'm in the mood and I'm bound to lose again
 But then again and again I said oh I said oh I said
 Oh babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you

; The intro if I remember is a hammering/picking thing
; between G, G6, G/B.
;
; The harmonica part is a riot (it's the only reason I play this fairly
; silly tune), if you have a G harp.
