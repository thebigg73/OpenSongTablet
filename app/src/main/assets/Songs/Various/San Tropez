 As I reach  for a peach slide a  ride down behind  the sofa in San Tropez
.Gmaj7
 Breaking  a stick with a brick on the sand riding a wave in the wake of
.             Gm6
 an old sedan 
.G7                                          A7
 Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness scratched by the sand that
.                   C7                                             D
 fell from our love deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling If
 you're alone I'll come home

;play this first time only, second time go to Coda

.Gmaj7                                            Gm6
 Backwards and home-bound the pigeon, the dove    gone with the wind and
.                        Gmaj7                                  Gm6
 the rain on an airplane owning a home with no silver spoon I'm drinking
.                            G7
 champagne like a big tycoon Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
.     A7                                    C7
 I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together Speeding away on a wind to a
.        D
 new day if you're alone I'll come home ..And I pause

;Back to top with these lyrics

.Gmaj7
 for a while by a country stile and listen to things they say. Digging for
 gold with a hoe in my hand hoping they'll take a look at the way things
 stand Would you lead me down to the place by the sea? I hear your soft
 voice calling to me. Making a date for later by phone. If you're alone
 I'll come

;Coda

 home.

;Repeat and fade out
