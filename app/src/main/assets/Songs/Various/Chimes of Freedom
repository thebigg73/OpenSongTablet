[Intro]  G C C/B D Dsus4
 C D G (notes: B C D G...)

.G                         C9
 Far between the sundown's finish
.    G                C9
 and midnights broken toll
.   G
 we ducked inside
.    C9      D       G
 the doorway thunder crashing  (notes: B C D G...)

.   G                 C9
 As majestic bells of bolts
.       G              C9
 struck shadows in the sounds
.G                 C9        D       G
 seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing

 (notes on low E string and open D: G F# E D...)

.D
 Flashing for the warriors
.      G           C9     G
 whose strength is not to fight
.C9               C9/B
 flashing for the refugees
.       Am              D
 of the unarmed road of flight
.        G              C9
 and for each and every underdog
.G              C9
 soldier in the night
.       G              C9        D       G
 and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing (notes: B C D G...)

 There are cities melted furnace
 unexpectedly we watched
 with faces hidden as the walls were tightening

 As the echo of the wedding bells
 before the blowing rain
 dissolved into the bells of the lightning

 Tolling for the rebel
 tolling for the rake
 tolling for the luckless
 they are bound and damned forsaked
 tolling for the outcasts
 burning constantly at stake
 and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

 Through the mad mystic hammering
 and the wild ripping hail
 the sky cracked its farms in naked wonder

 As the clanging of the church bells
 blew far into the breeze
 leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder

 Striking for the gentle
 striking for the kind
 striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
 and the poet and painter
 far behind his rightful time
 and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

 In the wild cathedral evening
 the rain unravelled tales
 for a disrobed faceless farms of no position

 Tolling for the tongues
 with no place to bring their thoughts
 all down and taken for granted situations

 Tolling for the deaf and blind
 tolling for the mute
 for a mistreated maidless mother, a mistitled prostitute
 for the misdemeanor outlaw
 chained and cheated by pursuit
 and we gaze upon the chimes of freedom flashing

 Even though the cloud's white curtain
 in a far off corner flashed
 and the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting

 Electric lights still struck like arrows
 fired but for the ones
 condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting

 Tolling for the searching ones
 on their speechless seeking trail
 for the lonesome hearted lovers with too personal a tale
 and for each unharmful gentle soul
 misplaced inside a jail
 and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

 Starry eyes and laughing
 as I recall when we were caught
 can't find no track of ours for they hang suspended

 As we listened one last time
 and we watched with one last look
 spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended

 Tolling for the aching ones
 whose wounds cannot be nursed
 or the countless confused accused misused
 strung out ones and worse
 and for every hung up person
 in the whole wide universe
 and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing</lyrics>
