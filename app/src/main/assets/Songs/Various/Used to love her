.D            A       G              A
 (( I used to love her, but I had to kill her
.D         A                   G                A
 I used to love her )) mmm - ya (( but I had to kill her
.G        A      G          A
 I had to put her, six feet under
.G         A                 D     G
 and I can still hear her complain ))                               *)

 (( I used to love her )) mmm - oh - ya (( but I had to
 kill her
 I used to love her )) mmm - ooh - ya (( but I had to
 kill her
 I knew I'd miss her,  so I had to keep her
 She's buried right in my backyard )) - ar - ar - ar -  ar - ar - ar
 - ar - ar - ar- oh - oh - wo - oh - ya

 { guitar solo } mmm - ooh - ya, wo - ooh - wo - oh -
 yeah

 (( I used to love her, but I had to kill her
 I used to love her )) mmm - oh - ya (( but I had to
 kill her
 She bit so much, she drove me nuts
 and now we're happier this way - ay - ay - ay - ay - ay          -
 ay - ay - ay - ay - ay - yeah

 { guitar solo } Wo - ooh - wo - ooh - ya
 Take it for what it is

 (( I used to love her, but I had to kill her
 I used to love her )) mmm - oh - ya (( but I had to
 kill her
 I had to put her )) mmm - ooh (( six feet under
 and I can still hear her complain )) - ya - ee - ya -
 een, uh!

 Throughout whole song:
 D  A  G  A  (2x)  G  A  G  A  G  A  D  G                           *)

 *) I'm not so sure about that last G. I think you should play the D,
 preceding the G, until the next verse.</lyrics>
