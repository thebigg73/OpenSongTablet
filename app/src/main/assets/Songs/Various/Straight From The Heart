.C
 I could stop dreaming, but in never ends.
 As long as you're gone we may as well pretend.
.          Bb   F Bb  C       G         C
 I been dreamin'     straight from the heart.

.C
 You say it's easy, but who's to say that we'd be
 able to keep it this way.
.         Bb    F Bb      C        G        C
 But it's easier,  comin' straight from the heart.

.                 F        G          C
 Oh give it to me straight from the heart
.                 F       G      C
 Tell me we could make another start
.                    Am              F
 You know I'll never go as long as I know it's comin
.C             G    C
 straight from the heart.

 I see you on the street some other time,
 When all the words will just fall out of line
 While we're dreamin' straight from the heart.

 Oh give it to me straight from the heart
 Tell me we could make another start
 You know I'll never go as long as I know it's comin
 straight from the heart.

;Instrumental break

 Straight from the heart
 Tell me we could make one more start
 You know I'll never go as long as I know, give it to me now
 straight from the heart.
 (repeat a bit then end it this way)
.F           C        G         C
 it's comin' straight from the heart</lyrics>
