.Em7                                  A9
 She packed my bags last night - pre-flight
.Em7               A9
 Zero hour, nine A.M.
.C                G         Am      D
 And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
.Em7                         A9
 I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
.Em7                 A9
 It's lonely out in space
.C         G        Am       D
 On such a timeless flight as this

;Chorus:
.G                                     C
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
.                                  G
 Til touchdown brings me 'round to find
.                                   C
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
.           G         A9
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
.C                              G
 Rocket man, burnin' out his up here alone

.Em7                           A9
 Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids
.Em7                  A9
 In fact it's cold as hell
.C                   G       Am                D
 And there's no one there to raise them if you did
.Em7                               A9
 And all this science, I don't understand
.Em7                         A9
 It's just my job five days a-week
.C        G  Am          D
 Rocket man - - - rocket man

;Chorus
.G                                     C
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
.                                  G
 Til touchdown brings me 'round to find
.                                   C
 I'm not the man they think I am at home
.           G         A9
 Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
.C                              G
 Rocket man, burnin' out his up here alone
.C                           G
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
.C                           G
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time</lyrics>
