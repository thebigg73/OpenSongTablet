.       F  Am   Bb        Am
 I see trees of green, red roses too
.Gm7       F        A7   Dm
 I see them bloom for me and you
.        Db       Gm7(C)  C7        F    F+5   Bmaj7
 And I think to myself what a wonderful world  
.C7    F   Am       Bb       Am
 I see skies of blue and clouds of white
.      Gm7        F   A7          Dm
 The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
.        Db       Gm7(C) C7        F    Bb       F
 And I think to myself what a wonderful world    
.      C7                  F
 The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
.      C7            F
 Are also on the faces of people goin' by
.       Dm      C(E)       Dm(F)        C(G)
 I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do!"
.Dm(F)     F#dim Gm7 F#dim C7
 They're really sayin' I love you
.     F    Am   Bb          Am
 I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
.Gm7              F           A7 Dm
 They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know
.        Db       Gm7(C)          F    Am7-5
 And I think to myself what a wonderful world
.D7    Gm7              C7-9        F     Bb6    F
 Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.</lyrics>
