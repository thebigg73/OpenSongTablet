.        A                         A     A           A     A
 Well, I ride on a mail train, baby,     can't buy a thrill
.       A             A                     A   A
 I been up all night, leanin' on the window sill
.      A    A/G    D          E   E
 Well, if I die on top of the hill
.         A                     A                A
 Well, if I don't make it mama, you know my baby will

 Don't the moon look good mama, shinin' through the trees
 Don't the brakemen look good mama, flaggin' down the double E's
 Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea
 But don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me

 Now the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost
 I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across
 I wanna be your lover baby, I don't wanna be your boss
 Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost</lyrics>
