.Am  F  Dm  G                 Am     F    G
              sha la la la la la la         uh huh...

.Am                    F         Dm              G
 I was down at the New Amsterdam staring at this yellow-haired girl
.    Am                       F                G
 Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
.Am                   F            Dm                      G
 She dances while his father plays guitar.  She's suddenly beautiful
.   Am                 F           G
 We all want something beautiful   I wish I was beautiful

.        Am                 F
 So come dance this silence down through the morning
.Dm           G           Am        F    G
    sha la la la la la la la  yeah         uh huh...
.Am      F       Dm                   G
 Cut up, Maria!  Show me some of them Spanish dances
.Am        F           G
 Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
.Am         F    Dm                 G
 Believe in me   Help me believe in anything
.        Am           F             G
 (cause) I want to be someone who believes

.C    F           G
 Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
.C                      F
 Stare at the beautiful women
.G
 "She's looking at you.  Ah, no, no, she's looking at me."
.C              F               G
 Smiling in the bright lights   Coming through in stereo
.     C         F          G
 When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

.Am              F         Dm              G
 I will paint my picture   Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
.Am                   F               G
 All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
.           Am                  F       Dm         G
 (you know) Gray is my favorite color I felt so symbolic yesterday
.Am          F             G
 If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

.C   F            G
 Mr. Jones and me look into the future
.C                      F
 Stare at the beautiful women
.G
 "She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me."
.C               F         G
 Standing in the spotlight I bought myself a gray guitar
.     C         F         G                   Am
 When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

.                Am
 I will never be lonely
.                    G
 I will never be lonely
.Am                   F
 I want to be a lion  Everybody wants to pass as cats
.Am                                   G
 We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that.
.Am                      F
 Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
.    Am                               G
 and I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe.

.C   F            G
 Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
.        C                      F
 Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
.       G
 "She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me."
.C                F
 I want to be Bob Dylan
.    G
 Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
.     C         F          G
 When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be.

.C    F           G
 Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
.       C               F                 G
 When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
.C                 F                 G
 We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
.         C           F                    G
 But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can
 be.
.C   F             G
 Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....
