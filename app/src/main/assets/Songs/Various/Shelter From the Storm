.D
 'Twas in another life time,
.G                   D
 One of toil and blood.
 When blackness was a virtue
.         G
 And the road was full of mud.
.D
 I came in from the wilderness,
.    G
 A creature void of form.
.      D
 "Come in" she said,
 "I'll give you,
.G
 Shelter from the storm."

 And if I pass this way again,
 You can rest assured,
 I'll always do my best for her
 On that I give my word.
 In a world of steel eyed death and men
 Who are fighting to be warm,
 Come in she said,
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm.

 Not a word was spoke between us.
 There was little risk involved.
 everything up to that point,
 Had been left unresolved.
 Try imagining a place
 Where it's always safe and warm
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm.

 I was burned out from exhaustion
 I was buried in the hail.
 Poisoned in the bushes
 An' blown out on the trail
 Hunted like a crocodile,
 Ravaged in the corn
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm

 Suddenly I turned around
 And she was standing there
 With silver bracelets on her wrists
 And flowers in her hair.
 She walked up to me so gracefully
 And took my crown of thorns
 Come in she said
 I'll give you,
 Shelter from the storm.

 Now there's a wall between us
 Something has been lost.
 I took too much for granted
 I got my signals crossed
 Just to think that all began
 On an uneventfull morn
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm

 Well the deputy walks on hard nails
 And the preacher rides a mount
 But nothing really matters
 It's doom alone that counts
 And the one-eyed undertaker
 He blows a futile horn
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm

 I've heard newborn babies wailin'
 Like a mornin' dove
 And old men with broken teeth
 Stranded without love.
 Do I understand your question, man
 Is it hopeless and forlorn.
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm.

 In a little hill top village
 I gambled for my clothes
 I bargained for salvation
 And they gave me a leathal dose.
 I offered up my innocence
 And got repaid with scorn
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm

 Well I'm livin' in a foreign country
 But I'm bound to cross the line.
 Beauty walk a razors edge,
 Someday I'll make it mine.
 If I could only turn the clock back
 To when God and her were born
 Come in she said
 I'll give you
 Shelter from the storm.</lyrics>
