;Intro (play twice... also play over D-Bm sections of verses):

;Verse 1:
 D   Bm                 D       Bm             D        Bm
 Anna   you come and ask me girl    to set you free girl
 D        Bm              Em      A7
 You say he loves you more than me   so I will set you free
 D      Bm              D   Bm
 Go with him   (Anna)   Go with him

;Verse 2:
 D  Bm                 D      Bm                D        Bm
 Anna   girl before you go now    I want you to know now
 D       Bm              Em        A7
 That I still love you so   but if he loves you more
D
 Go with him

;Middle:
G
 All of my life    I've been searching    for a girl
D
 Who'll love me     like I     love her
 G                         Gm
 But every girl I've ever had    breaks my heart and leave me sad
 E7                                 A7
 What am I   what am I   supposed to do    oh...

;Verse 3:
 D  Bm                 D        Bm
 Anna   just one more thing girl
 D      Bm                Em        A7
 You give back your ring to me     and I will set you free
D
 Go with him

;Repeat middle part
;Repeat verse 3

;Ending:
 Bm             D      Bm
 (Anna)  Go with him   (Anna)
 D           Bm              D
 You can go with him girl   (Anna)   Go with him</lyrics>
