[Intro] 
.G D G D G Bm A G

.G                 D  G           D
 It's time to move on,time to get going
.G          D            Bm        A
 What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
.G            D        G         D
 But under my feet,baby,grass is growing
.G                Bm   A                G
 It's time to move on, it's time to get going

.G      D       G                   D
 Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
.G                 D
 She's an honest deflector
.Bm              A
 Conscientious objector
.               G
 Now her own protector

.G      D       G             D
 Broken skyline, which way to love land
.G                      D
 Which way to something better
.Bm              A
 Which way to forgiveness
.               G
 Which way do I go

.G            D   G           D
 Time to move on, time to get going
.G          D            Bm        A
 What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
.G            D           G        D
 But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
.G                 Bm  A           G
 It's time to move on, time to get going

.G D

.G        D      G           D
 Sometime later, getting the words wrong
.G           D           Bm         A
 Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
.G        D
 Nauseous adrenalin
.G                  D
 Like breakin' up a dogfight
.G                  D
 Like a deer in the headlights
.Bm        A
 Frozen in real time
.          G
 I'm losing my mind

.G            D   G           D
 Time to move on, time to get going
.G         D             Bm        A
 What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
.G            D           G        D
 But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
.G                 Bm  A                G
 It's time to move on, it's time to get going
