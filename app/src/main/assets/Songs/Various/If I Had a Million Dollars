 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
.G    D         C
 I'd buy you a house (I would buy you a house)
.G     D              C
 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
.G            D                  C
 I'd buy you furniture for your house (Maybe a nice chesterfield or an ottoman)
.G     D              C
 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
.G    D         C
 I'd buy you a K-car (A nice reliant automobile)
.G     D              C                     D
 If I had a million dollars, I'd buy your love

.C     D             G                     Em               C
 If I had a million dollars, We'd build a tree fort in our yard
.C     D             G                   Em                      C
 If I had a million dollars,  You could help it wouldn't be that hard
.C     D             G                             Em               C
 If I had a million dollars, We could put like a little refrigerator in 			there (We could keep snacks and beverages)

 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 I'd buy you a fur coat (but not a real fur coat that's cruel)
 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 I'd buy you an exotic pet (Like a llama or an emu)
 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 I'd buy you John Merrick's remains (All them crazy elephant bones)
 If I had a million dollars, I'd buy your love

 If I had a million dollars, We wouldn't have to walk to the store
 If I had a million dollars, We'd take a limosine cause it costs more
 If I had a million dollars, We wouldn't have to eat craft dinner
 (but we would. We'd just eat more)

 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 I'd buy you a green dress (But not a real green dress, that's cruel)
 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 I'd buy you some art (A Picasso or a Garfunkel)
 If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 I'd buy you a monkey (Haven't you always wanted a monkey?)
 If I had a million dollars, I'd buy your love

 If I had a million dollars, If I had a million dollars
 If I had a million dollars, If I had a million dollars
 If I had a million dollars, I'd be rich</lyrics>
