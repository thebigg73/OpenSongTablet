 Six blade knife,  do anything for you
 Anything you want it to

 One blade breaking my heart, One blade tear me apart
 Yeah, six blade knife, do anything for you

 You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
 You come up from behind and lay it close on my skin
 Took a stone from my soul, when I was lame
 Just so that you, can make me tame
 Yeah, six blade knife, (it) do anything for you

.Dm              C            G  G
 I want to be free from it now    mm mm
.        D
 I dont want it no more
.Dm              C            G
 I want to be free from it now
.        D
 mm mm I dont want it no more

.Am C  D
       

 Everybody got a knife, they just want it like they want it to be
 A needle or a wife, something that you just cant see
 Your sixblade knife, keeps you strong
 It'll do me wrong,
 yeah, six blade knife, do anything for you.
 do any thing, anything</lyrics>
