.A
 Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
 somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole
 there's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
 somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
.          D
 there's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell
.        A
 there's leaking in the washroom there's a sneak in personnel
.E                                               D
 somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze
.  A
 'goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?
;repeat intro

 The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
 they're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most
 the watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas
 and everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease
 there's panic on the switchboard tongues are ties in knots
 some come out in sympathy some come out in spots
 some blame the management some the employees
 and everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease
;repeat intro

 The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks
 innocence is injured experience just talks
 everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
 that these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'
 on ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
 philosophy is useless theology is worse
 history boils over there's an economics freeze
 sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'
;repeat intro

 Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here
 you've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer
 I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis knees
 but worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'
 he wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed
 but I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
 come back and see me later - next patient please
 send in another victim of Industrial Disease'
;repeat intro

 I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck
 they got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
 two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong
 there's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says
 'they wanna have a war to keep us on our knees
 they wanna have a war to keep their factories
 they wanna have a war to stop us buying Japanese
 they wanna have a war to stop Industrial Disease
;repeat intro

 they're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
 they wanna sap your energy incarcerate your mind
 they give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three
 two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'
 meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon
 abolish monday mornings and friday afternoons'
 the other one's on a hunger strike he's dying by degrees
 how come Jesus gets Industrial Disease
;repeat intro (5 instead of 4 times)
