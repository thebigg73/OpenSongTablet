.D             A           G             D
 Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
.    F#m            Bm                 G              A
 And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are
.          Bm              F#m
 There are starts in every city
.         G                  A
 In every house and on every street
.           C                   G
 And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
.                        A      D
 Their names are written in concrete

 Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard
 She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
 But they turned her into a princess
 And they sat her on a throne
 But she turned her back on stardom
 Because she wanted to be alone

;Refrain
.        C                        G                   D
 You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
.C                        G                            D
 Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
.C                     G                          D
 People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
.C                      G                    D
 Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

 Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive
 And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by
 Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
 'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
 But stand close by Bette Davis
 Because hers was such a lonely life

 If you covered him with garbage
 George Sanders would still have style
 And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
 He would still turn round and smile
 But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
 'Cause she's not very tough
 She should have been made of iron or steel
 But she was only made of flesh and blood

;Refrain

 Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
 And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are
 And those who are successful
 Be always on your guard
 Success walks hand in hand with failure
 Along Hollywood Boulevard

 I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show
 A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
 Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
 And celluloid heroes never really die

 You can see all the stars as you walk along...
;Refrain

 La la la la....

 Oh, celluloid heroes never feel any pain
 Oh, celluloid heroes never really die
 I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show
 A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
 Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
 And celluloid heroes never really die</lyrics>
