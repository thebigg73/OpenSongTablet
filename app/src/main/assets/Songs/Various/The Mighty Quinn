.G                 D            G
 Come all without, come all within
.                D               C      G
 You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
.G                 D            G
 Come all without, come all within
.                D               C      G
 You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

.G           C        G         C
 Ev'rybody's building ships and boats
.G                 C           G                  C
 Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes.
.G           C            G             C
 Ev'rybody's in despair, ev'ry girl and boy
.         G                D
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
.      C                    G
 Ev'rybody's gonna jump for joy.
 Come all without...

.  G               C                G             C
 I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
.    G                  C                  G               C
 But jumping queues and making haste, just ain't my cup of meat.
.G           C                          G            C
 Ev'ryone's beneath the trees, feeding pigeons on a limb
.         G                D
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
.        C                    G
 All the pigeons gonna rum to him.
 Come all without...

.G                C           G              C
 Let me do what I wanna do, I can recite 'em all
.      G               C              G               C
 Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
.G           C                    G                    C
 Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on ev'ryones toes.
.         G                D
 But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
.      C                 G
 Ev'rybody's gonna wanna doze.</lyrics>
