.D                Em
 Clouds so swift, rain won't lift,
.G                      D
 Gates won't close, the railing's froze.
.                  Em
 Get your mind off winter time,
.G                 D
 You ain't goin' nowhere.

;Chorus:
.D            Em
 Oooo, Eeeee, Ride me high,
.G                    D
 One of these days my man's gonna come.
.         Em
 Oh Lord, we gonna fly,
.G                D
 Down in the easy chair.

 I don't care how many letters they sent,
 Morning came and morning went.
 Pick up your money and pack your tent,
 But we still ain't goin' nowhere.

;Chorus.

 Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots,
 Tailgates and substitutes,
 Strap yourself with the tree with roots,
 You ain't goin' nowhere.

;Chorus.

 Ghengis Khan he could not keep
 All his kings supplied with reap.
 Climb that hill no matter how steep,
 We still ain't goin' nowhere.

;Chorus.</lyrics>
