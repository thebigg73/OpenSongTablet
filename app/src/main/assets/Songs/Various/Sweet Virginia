.C                      A                 G
 Wading through the waste        stormy winter
 Thank you for your wine            California

.C                      A                  G
 and there's   not a friend  to help you through
 thank you   for your sweet   and bitter fruits

.C                      A                  G        C
 Trying to stop the waves  behind your eye-balls    
 Yes   I  got  the   desert   in   my     toe-nail

.G                     D                        G   C
 Drop your reds       drop your greens  an blues    
 And I hid the speed insdie       my       shoes

.C                     A                 G
 Come on,  come on down,   Sweet    Virginia
.C                     A                 G
 Come on,  honey  Child     I beg of    you
.C                     A                 G        C
 Come on,  come on down,     you got it in you    
.G                         D7            G        C
 Got to scrape that shit   right off your shoes</lyrics>
