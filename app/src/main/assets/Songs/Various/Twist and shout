;Play with a C  F  G  F chord progression

 Well shake it up baby now, twist and shout
 Come on come on come on come on baby , now work it on out
 Well work it on out  , you know you look so good
 You know you got me goin' now , just like you knew you would

;Break  ||:  C  F  G  F  :|| x4

 Ahh  Ahh   Ahh  Ahh  Ahh

 Well shake it up baby now, twist and shout
 Come on come on come on come on baby , now work it on out
 You know you twist it little girl , you know you twist so fine
 Come on and twist a little closer now, and let me know that you're mine

;Break

 Well shake it up baby now, twist and shout
 Come on come on come on come on baby , now work it on out
 You know you twist it little girl , you know you twist so fine
 Come on and twist a little closer now, and let me know that you're mine

;Break

 Well shake it shake it shake it baby now
 Well shake it shake it shake it baby now
 Well shake it shake it shake it baby now</lyrics>
