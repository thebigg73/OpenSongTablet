.         D   A     G  GDG
[Intro]                  

.A            G              A    G
 Whenever we hold each other, we hold each other
.F#m                       G     F#m               G
 There's a feeling that's gone, something has gone wrong
.      A                   G             A
 And I don't know how much longer I can take it
.      G                 A
 How speed of heart can break it
.        G                        A              G
 Take my head in your hands and shake it in this near wild heaven
.                D         A                  G
 Not near enough (living inside, living inside)
.                           D               A             G
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)

 Whatever it takes I'm giving, it's just a gift I'm giving
 Try to live inside, try to move inside
 And I always thought that it would make me smarter
 But it's only made me harder
 My heart flown open wide in this near wild heavan
 Not near enough (living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven

 Holding my hands together, holding my feet together
 Holding myself together in this near wild heaven
 not near enough (living inside, living inside)
 Not near enough (living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)
 Near wild heaven (living inside, living inside, living inside)</lyrics>
