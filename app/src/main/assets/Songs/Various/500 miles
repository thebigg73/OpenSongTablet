.       E
 When I wake up yeah I know I'm gonna be
.          A              B                E
 I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
.       E
 When I go out yeah I know I'm gonna be
.          A              B               E
 I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you

.     E
 If I get drunk yes I know I'm gonna be
.          A              B                  E
 I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
.         E
 And if I haver yeah I know I'm gonna be
.          A                B           E
 I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you

;Chorus
 But I would walk 500 miles
 And I would walk 500 more
 Just to be the man who walked 1,000 miles
 To fall down at your door

 When I'm working yes I know I'm gonna be
 I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
 And when the money comes in for the work I'll do
 I'll pass almost every penny on to you

 When I come home yeah I know I'm gonna be
 I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
 And if I grow old well I know I'm gonna be
 I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

 When I'm lonely yes I know I'm gonna be
 I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
 When I'm dreaming yes I know I'm gonna dream
 Dream about the time when I'm with you</lyrics>
