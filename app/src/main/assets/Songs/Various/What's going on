.  E                              C#m
 Mother, mother, there's too many of you crying
.  E                                             C#m
 Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying
.                A
 You know we'ver got to find a way
.              B7
 To bring some lovin' here today, hey

 Father, father, we don't need to escalate
 War is not the answer, for only love can conquer hate
 You know we've got to find a way
 To bring some lovin' here today

;CHORUS #1:
.  A
 Picket lines and picket signs

 Don't punish me with brutality

 Talk to me, so you can see
.            E               C#m
 Oh what's going on, what's going on
.         E                         C#m
 Yeah, what's going on, ah, what's going on
.  A     B7
 Ahhh....

 Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong
 Ah but who are they to judge us
 Simply 'cos our hair is long
 Ah you know we'ver got to find a way
 To brind some understanding here today

;CHORUS #2:
 Picket lines and picket signs
 Don't punish me with brutality
 Talk to me, so you can see
 What's going on, yeah what's going on
 Tell me what's going on, I'll tell you what's going on
