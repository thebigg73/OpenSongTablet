.D               A/C#            Bm7                 A
   Your ever lastin' summer, you can see it fadin' fast,
.D                       A/C#            Bm7                 A
   So you grab a piece of somethin' that you think is gonna last.
.         A7/E               Ebdim          Dm                 A
 Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand;
.D                     A/C#            Bm7            A
   The things you think are precious I can't understand.

.                       Gmaj9                    A
 Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
.                         Gmaj9                         A
 Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
.                      Gmaj9                    A
 Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
.                         Gmaj9                         F#m7
 Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine

.D                            A/C#     Bm7             A
   You been tellin' me you're a genius since you were seventeen;
.D               A/C#               Bm7                        A
   In all the time I've known you I still don't know what you mean.
.    A7/E             Ebdim           Dm               A
 The weekend at the college didn't turn out like you planned;
.D                 A/C#              Bm7           A
   The things that pass for knowledge I can't understand.

;chorus

.D                     A/C#         Bm7            A
   I've spent a lit of money and I spent a lot of time;
.D                     A/C#      Bm7                A
   The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind.
.     A7/E                 Ebdim             Dm            A
 After all the things we've done and seen you find another man;
.D                      A/C#          Bm7         A
   The things you think are useless I can't understand.
