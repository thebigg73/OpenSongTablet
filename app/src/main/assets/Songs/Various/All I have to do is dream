.     C      Am  Dm7     G7
 When I want you  in my arms
.     C       Am Dm             G7
 When I want you  and all your charms
.    C       Am
 Whenever I want you
. F            G7     C   Am  F             G7
 All I have to do is dream, dream, dream, dream.

.     C        Am Dm       G7
 When I feel blue  in the night
.    C      Am  Dm           G7
 And I need you  to hold me tight
.    C       Am
 Whenever I want you
. F            G7      C   F C C7
 All I have to do is dream.

 I can make you mine taste your lips of wine
.Dm     G7         C  C7
 anytime night or day.
.F               Em
 Only trouble is  gee whiz,
.     D7               G7
 I'm dreaming my life away.

.    C      Am Dm             G7
 I need you so  that I could die.
.    C      Am Dm            G7
 I love you so  and that is why.
.    C       Am       F            G7      C   F C
 Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream.</lyrics>
