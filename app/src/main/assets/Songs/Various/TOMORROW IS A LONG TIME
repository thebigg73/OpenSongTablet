.G                   C       G
 If today was not an endless highway
.G                    C       G
 If tonight was not a crooked trail
.   C        D             G
 If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
.     C              D               G
 Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all

.         C          D                 G
 Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin'
.         C                   D              G
 Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin'
.C       D             G
 Only if she was lyin' by me
.         C         D         G
 Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

 I can't see my reflection in the water
 I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
 I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
 Or can't remember the sound of my own name

 There's beauty in the silver, singing river
 There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
 But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
 That I remember in my true love's eyes.</lyrics>
