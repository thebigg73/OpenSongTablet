.Em             A            Bm         Bm7
 I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear
.Em         A                Bm  Bm7
 I like my toast done on the side
.Em           A            Bm            Bm7
 And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
.        Em        A       Bm Bm7
 I'm an Englishman in New York

 See me walking down Fifth Avenue
 A walking cane here at my side
 I take it everywhere I walk
 I'm an Englishman in New York
.Em      A      Bm          Bm7
 I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
.        Em        A       Bm Bm7
 I'm an Englishman in New York
.Em      A      Bm          Bm7
 I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
.        Em        A       Bm Bm7
 I'm an Englishman in New York

 If "manners maketh man" as someone said
 Then he's the hero of the day
 It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
 Be yourself no matter what they say

 I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
 I'm an Englishman in New York
 I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
 I'm an Englishman in New York
.D                       A         A7
 Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
.Bm           Bm7             F#
 You could end up as the only one
. G                        A
 Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
.   Gdim7                              Bm
 At night a candle's brighter than the sun

 Takes more than combat gear to make a man
 Takes more than license for a gun
 Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
 A gentleman will walk but never run

 If "manners maketh man" as someone said
 Then he's the hero of the day
 It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
 Be yourself no matter what they say

 I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien
 I'm an Englishman in New York
 I'm an alien   I'm a legal alien</lyrics>
