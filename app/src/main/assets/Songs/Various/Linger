.    D
 if you
 if you could return
.             A
 don't let it burn  don't let it fade
.                    C
 i'm sure i won't be rude
 but it's just your attitude
.                 G
 it's tearing me apart it's ruining everyday.

;Alternate A and A6 between measures to add some variety to it.

 I swore, I swore I would be true
 but honey so did you
 so why were you holding her hand
 is that the way we stand
 were you lying all the time
 was it just a game to you

 But I miss you
 you know I'm such a fool for you
 you got me wrapped around your finger
 do you have to let it linger
 do you have to
 do you have to
 do you have to let it linger

 Oh, I thought I loved you
 I thought that nothing could go wrong
 but I was wrong
 I was wrong

 If you, if you could get by
 trying not to lie
 things wouldn't be so confused
 and I wouldn't feel so used
 but you always ruin you
 I just wanna be with you

 and I miss you
 you know I'm such a fool for you
 you got me wrapped around your finger
 do you have to let it linger
 do you have to
 do you have to
 do you have to let it linger

 and I miss you
 you know I'm such a fool for you
 you got me wrapped around your finger
 do you have to let it linger
 do you have to
 do you have to
 do you have to let it linger

 you know I'm such a fool for you
 you got me wrapped around your finger
 do you have to let it linger
 do you have to
 do you have to
 do you have to let it linger</lyrics>
