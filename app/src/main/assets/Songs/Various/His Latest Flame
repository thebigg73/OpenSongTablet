.             F  Dm           F Dm
 A very old friend came by today
.              F         Dm
 'Cos he was telling everyone in town
.F                    Dm
 About the love that he just found
.                  Bb C7                  Dm
 And Marie's the name  of his latest flame

;Chorus :
.C7                   Bb                    C7  Bb
 Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
.    C7                Bb                  C7 Bb
 I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
.C7              Bb                      C7    Bb
 He was gone but still his words kept returning
.      C7                Bb              F
 What else was there for me to do but cry

 He talked and talked and I heard him say
 That she had the longest blackest hair
 The prettiest green eyes anywhere
 And Marie's the name of his latest flame

 Would you believe that yesterday
 This girl was in my arms and swore to me
 She'd be mine eternally
 And Marie's the name of his latest flame</lyrics>
