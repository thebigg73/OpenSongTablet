.        Dm                             Am
 They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
.       Dm                              Am
 For trying to change the system from within
.       Dm                       Am
 I'm coming now I'm coming to reward them
.  G                  F  E                 Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

.       Dm                        Am
 I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
.       Dm                         Am
 I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
.       Dm                         Am
 I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
.  G                  F  E                 Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

.    C                                G  F
 I'd really like to live beside you, baby
.              C                             Am
 I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
.         C                                       Am
 But you see that line there moving through the station
.    G          F          E                      Am
 I told you I told you I told you I was one of those
[]

.       Dm                              Am
 You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win
.     Dm                             Am
 You know the way to stop me but you don't have the discipline
.     Dm                                Am
 How many nights I prayed for this: to let my work begin
.  G                  F  E                 Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

.Dm                                   Am
 I don't like your fashion business, mister
.Dm                                      Am
 I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
.Dm                                  Am
 I don't like what happened to your sister
.  G                  F  E                 Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
;chorus

.       Dm                                Am
 And I thank you for those items that you sent me
.    Dm                         Am
 The monkey end the plywood violin
.    Dm                               Am
 I practiced every night and now I'm ready
.  G                  F  E                 Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

.   Dm                            Am
 Remember me, I used to live for music
.   Dm                                  Am
 Remember me, I brought your groceries in
.       Dm                          Am
 It's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
.  G                  F  E                 Am
 First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin</lyrics>
