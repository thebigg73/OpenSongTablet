;Intro
.E  A  E  B
          

;1st Verse
;Bouncy E A E B
 Albert's always sincere, he's a sensivitive type
 His intentions are clear, he wanna be well-liked
 Better think of nothing, all are we anything (???)
 Better to be better than to be anything

.    A                                       E  A  E  B
 And Albert's vision is blooming uncontrolled         
.   A
 All his wings are slowly sinking

;Chorus
.        C#m     B       A        E
 And the world begins to disappear
.    C#m          B         A       E
 The worst things come from inside here
.    C#m     B          A       E
 And all the king's men reappear
.       F#m                    A
 For an eggman, on and off the wall
.A
 Will never be together again

.E A E B
       

;2nd Verse
 Einstein down on the beach staring into the sand
 It's everything he believes in has been shattered
 What you fear in the night in the day comes to call anyway-ay
 We all get burned as:

;Bridge
.A                                           E A E B
 One more sun comes sliding down the sky           
.A
 One more shadow leans against the wall

;Chorus
.G#m      A              G#m
 Albert's waiting in the sun
.     A
 On a field (?) American
.G#m       A             B
   For the cause of some inflated form of hit and run

;Solo
;Bridge
;Chorus
.G#m        A             G#m
   Albert's fallen on the sun
.            A
 Cracked his head wide open

;Chorus x2

;Ad lib outro
.E A E B
 No never be together again
 No no never never never again, uh huh
 What you fear in the night etc..</lyrics>
