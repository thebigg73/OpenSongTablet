.          A        D   A
 There she stood in the street
.Dadd4            D           A
 Smiling from her head to her feet,
.        A          D  A
 I said ''Hey, what is this?''
.              Dadd4       D         A
 Now  baby, maybe she's in need of a kiss.

 I said 'Hey, what's your name, baby,
 maybe we can see things the same.
 Now don't you wait or  hesitate,
 Let's move before they raise the parking rate.''

;Chorus
.A         G              D         A
 All right now Baby, it's all right now
.A         G              D         A
 All right now Baby, it's all right now

 I took her home to my place
 Watching ev'ry move on her face,
 She said ''Look, what's your game baby
 are you tryin' to put in shame?''

 I said ''slow, don't go so fast,
 don't you think that love can last?''
 She said ''Love, Lord above,
 now you're tryin' to trick me in love.''

;Chorus
 All right now baby, it's all right now
 All right now baby, it's all right now

;Pretty basic version but it's a start, Right?!</lyrics>
