.E             B/D# C#m         A
 I'll never be your beast of burden
.E          B/D#  C#m        A
 My back is broad but it's a hurting
.E     B/D#        C#m         A
 All I want is for you to make love to me
.E             B/D# C#m         A
 I'll never be your beast of burden
.E               B/D#   C#m         A
 I've walked for miles, my feet are hurting
.E     B/D#        C#m         A         B/D# C#m
 All I want is for you to make love to me

.A                     E/G#              A
 Am I hard enough Am I rough enough Am I rich enough
.    E/G#          A  B
 I'm not too blind to see

.E             B/D# C#m      A
 I'll never be your beast of burden
.E            B/D#  C#m        A
 So let's go home and draw the curtains
.E             E/D#
 Music on the radio
.C#m           A                    E B/D# C#m
 Come on baby, make sweet love to me

.A                     E/G#              A
 Am I hard enough Am I rough enough Am I rich enough
.    E/G#          A  B                     E
 I'm not too blind to see...oh little sister
.   E/D#    C#m         A
 Pretty, pretty, pretty girl

 E  B/D#  C#m | A | E  B/D#  C#m | C#m  A | E  B/D#  C#m |

.A             E                               A
 You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
.E                             A
 Pretty, pretty such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
.E             A
 Come on, baby please, please, please

.A           E
 I'll tell ya
.               B/D# C#m   A
 You can put me out on the street
.E                        A
 Put me out with no shoes on my feet
.    E           B/D#  C#m                        A   E B/D# C#m
 But put me out, put me out, put me out... out of misery
.E          B/D#     C#          A
 All your sickness I can suck it up
.E              E/D#
 Throw it all at me
.C#m            A
 I can shrug it off
.   E               B/D#  C#m          A
 There's one thing, baby, I don't understand
.E        E/G#         A
 You keep telling me I ain't your kind of man

.        E
 Ain't I rough enough
.A       E       B/D#C#m
 Ain't I tough enough
.A       E
 Ain't I rich enough
.     B/D#  C#m
 In love enough
.     A          E B/D# C#m
 Ooh  Ooh  please

;Repeat verse 1

 End:
 I don't need no beast of burden
 I need no fussing, I need no nursing
 Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be...
