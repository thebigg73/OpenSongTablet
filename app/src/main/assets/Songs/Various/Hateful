.      C
 Well, I got a friend who's a man (who's a man?)
.                                        D
 What man? The man who keeps me from the lonely    the only
.   C
 He gives me what I need (What you need?)
.                              G
 What ya got? I need it all so badly

;Chorus
[C]
.    C    C/B    Am
 Oh, anything I want
.C        C/B   Am
 He gives it to me
.C   C/B     Am     C        C/B
 Anything I want    he gives it
.      Am                 C
 But,  not for free, it's hateful
.         E7sus4/B
 and it's paid for
.           Am              G        A Bb
 And I'm so grateful  to be nowhere

 This year I've lost some friends (some friends?)
 What friends? I dunno I ain't even noticed
 You see, I gotta go out again
 My friend, i gotta see the main man

;Chorus

 I killed all my nerves
 What swerves? I can't drive so steady (and already)
 I've lost my memory (What mind?)
 Behind, I can't see so clearly.

;Chorus

.C   C/B     Am   C   C/B     Am
 Anything I want, anything I want</lyrics>
