.   Am                         B                               E
 Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
.  Am                                        B                         E
 Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess
.      C#m           G#m                F#m             E
 They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
. C#m             G#m               F#m               E
 She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
.          G#m            A
 I can't help it if I'm lucky

 People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
 Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
 Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
 I couldn't believe after all these years
 You didn't know me better than that, sweet lady

;CHORUS #1:
. E            A                               E
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
.   A                                 B
 Blowing down the backroads headin' south
. E              A                             E
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
.                  A             B                                E
 You're an idiot babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

 I ran into the fortune teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
 I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's
 like  There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door
 You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done
 In the final end he won the war after losin' every battle

 I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
 Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
 stars  You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
 One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes
 Blood on your saddle

;CHORUS #2:
 Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
 Blowing through the curtains in your room
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
 You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

 It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
 You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart
 Now everything's a little upside down
 As a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
 What's good is bad, what's bad is good
 You'll find out when you reach the top, you're on the bottom

 I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
 I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed
 Your eyes don't look into mine
 The priest wore black on the seventh day
 And sat stone faced while the building burned
 I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees
 While the springtime turned slowly into autumn

;CHORUS #3:
 Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
 From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
 Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
 You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

 I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
 Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else
 instead  Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
 I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
 And all your ragin' glory

 I been double crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free
 I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline
 Which separated you from me
 You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
 And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
 And it makes me feel so sorry

;CHORUS #4:
 Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
 Blowing through the letters that we wrote
 Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
 We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves</lyrics>
