 F  /  Dm  /  Bb  C/G  F  /  /  /

. F               Dm        Bb       C/G            F
 Maybe I'm still hurting I can't turn   the other cheek
.                           Dm           C/G       Bb        F
 But you know that I still love you it's just that I can't speak
.   Bb               F                  A                Bb
 I looked for you in everyone and they called me on that too
.   F      C       Dm    Am   Bb      C       F
 I lived alone but I was only coming back to you
.                           Dm                   Bb       C/G       F
 They're shutting down the factory now just when all the bills are due
.                              Dm
 And the fields they're under lock and key
.           C/G          Bb          F
 Though the rain and the sun come through
.      Bb                    F                   A                Bb
 And springtime starts but then it stops in the name of something new
.     F       C      Dm     Am        Bb      C       F
 And all the senses rise against this coming back to you
.             Bb              F                  Bb               F
 And they're handing down my sentence now and I know what I must do
.  A             Bb                 G              C
 Another mile of silence while I'm coming back to you
.  F            Dm                Bb   C/G      F
 There are many in your life and many still to be
.                 Dm                   C/G   Bb          F
 Since you are a shining light there's many that you'll see
.       Bb               F               A                 Bb
 But I have to deal with envy when you choose the precious few
.        F           C          Dm     Am     Bb      C       F
 Who've left their pride on the other side of coming back to you

 Bb  /  F  /  Bb  /  F  /  A  /  Bb  /  G  /  C  /  /  /

.F             Dm     Bb       C/G           F
 Even in your arms I know I'll never get it right
.               Dm             C/G     Bb      F
 Even when you bend to give me comfort in the night
.     Bb                F               A             Bb
 I've got to have your word on this or none of it is true
.     F        C        Dm      Am     Bb      C       F
 And all I've said was just instead of coming back to you</lyrics>
