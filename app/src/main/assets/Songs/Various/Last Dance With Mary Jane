[Intro  Am (hammer on index finger)  G    D   Am

.Am                G
 She grew up in an Indiana town
.      D                     A
 Had a good lookin' momma who never was around
.       Am                    G
 But she grew up tall and she grew up right
.          D                  Am
 With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night

 Well she moved down here at the age of 18
 She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen
 I was introduced and we both started groovin'
 She said, "I dig you baby but I got to keep movin'"
...on, keep movin' on

;Chorus
[C
.D
 Last dance with Mary Jane
.                               A
 One more time to kill the flame
.D
 I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
.                         A
 Tired of this town again 
[
 Am |  G |||   D |||  Am |

 Well I don't know but I've been told
 You never slow down, you never grow old
 I'm tired of screwing up, I'm tired of bein' down
 I'm tire of myself, I'm tired of this town
 Oh my my, oh hell yes
 Honey put on that party dress
 Buy me a drink, sing me a song,
 Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

;Chorus

 There's pidgeons down in Market Square
 She's standin' in her underwear
 Lookin' down from a hotel room
 Nightfall will be comin' soon
 Oh my my, oh hell yes
 You've got to put on that party dress
 It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
 I hit the last number, I walked to the road   (???)

 Repeat chorus and fade.</lyrics>
