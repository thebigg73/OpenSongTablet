;Chorus
.B           A                           B
 Lovely Rita meter maid      Lovely Rita meter maid

.E           D     A    E                  B
 Lovely Rita meter maid nothing can come between us
.C#m                 F#7             B
 When it gets dark I tow your heart away
.E             A             D                G
 Standing by a parking meter  when I caught a glimpse of Rita
.E                          B
 filling in a ticket in her little white book

 In a cap whe looked much older, and the bag across her shoulder
 made her look a little like a military man

.E C#m F#m7 B7

.E           D     A    E                D
 Lovely Rita meter maid may I enquire discreetly
.C#m                  F#7                B  A/B G#m/B F#m/B
 When are you free to take some tea with me?
.E6/B        B7        E D A E B7 E F#7 B7
 Ah                Rita

;Chorus

 Took her out and tried to win her, had a laugh, and over dinner
 told her I would really like to see her again
 Got the bill and Rita paid it, took her home, I nearly made it,
 sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

 Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid, where would I be without you?
 Give us a wink and make me think of you

;Chorus</lyrics>
