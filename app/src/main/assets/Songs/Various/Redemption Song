.    G                      Em7
 Old Pirates, yes, they rob I.
.    C         G/B           Am
 Sold I to the merchant ships
.G                      Em  C         G/B       Am
 minutes after they took I   from the bottomless pit.
.       G            Em7
 But my hand was made strong
.C           G/B          Am
 By the hand of the Almighty.
.     G                  Em   C          D
 We forward in this generation triumphantly.

;Chorus
.                      G  C    D          G
 Won't you help to sing    these songs of freedom?
.       C     D       Em  C   D      G
 'Cause all I ever had,    redemption songs,
.C   D      G      C
  redemption songs.

.D     G                           Em7
 Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
.           C           G/B            Am
 None but ourselves can free our minds.
.       G                    Em
 Have no fear for atomic energy,
.              C         G/B           Am
 'Cause none of them can stop the time.
.    G                        Em7
 How long shall they kill our prophets
.        C       G/B           Am
 While we stand aside and look?
.             G            Em
 Yes, some say it's just a part of it.
.      C                 D
 We've got to fulfill the book.

;Chorus

 Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
 None but ourselves can free our minds.
 Have no fear for atomic energy,
 'Cause none of them can stop the time.
 How long shall they kill our prophets
 While we stand aside and look?
 Yes, some say it's just a part of it.
 We've got to fulfill the book.
 Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom?
 'Cause all I ever had, redemption songs,
 These songs of freedom, songs of freedom.
