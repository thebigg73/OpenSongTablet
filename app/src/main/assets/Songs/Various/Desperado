.     G     G7            C               Cm
 Desperado, why don't you come to your senses ?
.         G                     A7         D7
 You been out ridin' fences for so long now
.             G         G7          C               Cm
 Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
.      G           B7      Em7          A7       D7  G
 These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow

.D         Em                Bm
 Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,
.       C                 G
 She'll beat you if she's able,
.             Em7                C                G   D
 You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet 
.       Em               Bm                    C              G
 Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
.        Em            A7             Am7
 But you only want the ones you can't get

.D  D7 G    G7           C              Cm
 Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger,
.     G                Em7          A7          D7
 Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
.    G        G7                C              Cm
 And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
.     G            Em7               A7        D7 G
 Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

.D          Em                   Bm
 Don't your feet get cold in the winter time ?
.    C                  G
 The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
.     Em7              C                   G   D
 It's hard to tell the night time from the day 
.       Em              Bm
 You're losin' all your highs and lows
.         C             G             Am7
 Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

.D  D7G     G7            C               Cm
 Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
.     G         D       Em   A7       D7
 Come down from your fences, open the gate
.          G         G7            C                 Cm
 It may be rainin',  but there's a rainbow above you 
.           G       B7   Em        C G Am7
 You better let somebody love you,     
.           G       B7   Em         Am7       D7  G
 You better let somebody love you before it's too late</lyrics>
