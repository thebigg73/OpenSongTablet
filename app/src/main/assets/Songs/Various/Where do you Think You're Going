.Am
 Where do you think you're going
.F
 Don't you know it's dark outside
.G
 Where do you think you're going
.Esus4           E
 Don't you care about my pride
.Am
 Where do you think you're going
.F
 I think you don't know
.G
 You got no way of knowing
.E                   Am
 You got no place to go

 I understand your changes
 How long before you reach the door
 I know where you think you're going
 I know what you came here for
 And now I'm sick of joking
 You know I like you to be free
 Where do you think you're going
 I think you'd better go with me, girl

 You say there is no reason
 But you still find cause to doubt me
 When you ain't with me girl
 You're gonna be without me

 Where do you think you're going
 Don't you know it's dark outside
 Where do you think you're going
 Don't you care about my pride
 And now I'm sick of joking
 You know I like you to be free
 Where do you think you're going
 I think you'd better go with me, girl</lyrics>
