.C#7#9                                 F#7
 You jump in front of my car when you, you know all the time, that a
.C#7#9                             F#7
 Ninety mi-les an hour girl is the speed I drive
.Bm7                        E7b9
 You tell me it's al-right, you don't mind a little pain
.Am7                         G#7b5
 You say you just want me to take you for a drive

 You're just like
[C]
.C#7#9                          F#7
 (Crosstown traffic) so hard to get through to you
.C#7#9                               F#7
 (Crosstown traffic) I don't need to run over you
.C#7#9
 (Crosstown traffic) all you do is slow me down
.        Bsus4
 and I'm trying to get to the other side of town

.C#7#9                       F#
 I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
.C#7#9                                  F#
 Tyre tracks all across your back I can (heh) I can see you had your fun
.         B7#9                      E7b9
 But ah,   darlin' can't you see my signals turn from green to red
.A7#9                             G#7b5
 and with you I see a traffic jam straight up ahead
