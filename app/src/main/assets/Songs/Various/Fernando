 Can you hear the drums Fernando?
.                                                F#m
 I remember long ago another starry night like this
.                        Bm
 In the firelight Fernando
.                                                             E
 You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar

 I could hear the distant drums and sounds
.                                    A
 of bugle calls were coming from afar

;Chorus:
.                                        E
 There was something in the air that night
.                               A
 The stars were bright, Fernando
.                             E                          A
 They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando
.                                        F#                  B7
 Though we never thought that we could lose, there's no regret
.                           E                              A
 If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando
.                           E                              A
 If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando

;Other verses :
 They were closer now Fernando
 Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
 I was so afraid Fernando
 We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
 And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
 Almost made me cry

 Now we're old and grey Fernando
 And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
 Can you hear the drums Fernando?
 Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
 I can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight
 For freeedom in this land</lyrics>
