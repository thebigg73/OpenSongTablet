.E                                A
 Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all
.                         E                                       A
 You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled
.                         E                         A
 They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain
.                        E                                      A
 They sent you on a treadmill and they made you change your name

;Chorus:

.B                                   B7
 And it seems to me you lived your life
.        E                A
 Like a candle in the wind
.        E                               B
 Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
.            A                                      C#m
 And I would have liked to've known you but I was just a kid
.                         B               A             E
 Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

;Other verses:
 Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played
 Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid
 And even when you died, oh, the press still hounded you
 All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude

 Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all
 You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled
 Goodbye Norma Jean, from a young man in the twenty second row
 Who sees you as something more than sexual, more than just our Marilyn Monroe</lyrics>
