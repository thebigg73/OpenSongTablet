.D         A   G    D        D     A       G      D
 I see the bad moon rising,  I see trouble on the way
.D     A    G          D          D     A   G     D
 I see earthquakes and lightning, I see bad times today

;Chorus:
[C]
.G                                   D
 Don't go around tonight,  well it's bound to take your life
.A         G               D
 There's a bad moon on the rise

.D      A    G     D         D          A      G      D
 I hear hurricanes blowing,  I know the end is coming soon
.D      A      G   D         D          A        G        D
 I fear rivers overflowing,  I hear the voice of rage and ruin

;Chorus

.D        A        G      D          D            A     G           D
 Hope you got your things together,  hope you are quite prepared to die
.D          A            G     D         D          A     G      D
 Looks like we're in for nasty weather,  one eye is taken for an eye

;Chorus
