[Intro]          

.     G                  C  D        G     G7
 Oh yes, I'm the Great           Pretender,
.C                         G G7
 Pretending I'm doing well.
.     C          D       G           C C#
 My need is such, I pretend too much,
.        G        C  D         G
 I'm lonely but no one can tell

.        G           C   D   G   G7
 Oh yes, I'm the great pretender,
.  C                         G G7
 Adrift in a world  of my own
.C               D    G            C  C#
 I play the game, but to my real shame
.        G               C       D G
 You've left me to dream all alone.

.        C                               G
 Too real is this feeling of make believe,
.        C                               G       D
 Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

.    G                 C  C  G  G7
 Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
.    C                            G G7
 Just lauging and gay like a clown
.    C      D            G           C C#
 I seem to be, what I'm not, you see,
.        G            D            Bmin C C#
 I'm wearing my heart like a crown,
.        G               C  D      G
 Pretending that you're still around
.        C                               G       D D#
 Too real when I fell what my heart can't conceal

.     G#               C#        C# G# G#7
 Oh yes, I'm the great   pretender
.    C#                           G# G#7
 Just lauging and gay like a clown
.    C#   D#             G#          C# C#
 I seem to be, what I'm not, you see,
.        G#           D#           B#min C# D
 I'm wearing my heart like a crown,
.        G#              C#
 Pretending that you're...
.        G#              C#                 G#
 Pretending that your're....         still around...
