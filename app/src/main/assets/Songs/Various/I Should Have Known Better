 I - - - - - - should have known better with a girl like  you,
.              C          G7           Am
 That I would love everything that you do,
.       F            G7         C    G7    C    G7
 And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do.            Whoa, ooh
.C    G7    C   G7        C            G7        C  G7
 I - - - - - -  never realized what a kiss could be,
.           C    G7        Am
 This could only happen to me,
.           F             E7   Am
 Can't you see, can't you see? 
.             F               C        E7 Am
 That when I tell you that I love you, oh,
.              F               C                           F
 You're gonna say you love me too - oo - oo - oo - oo, oho,

 And when I ask you to be mine,     you're gonna say you love me too.
. G7         C    G7    C    G7            C              G7       C   G7
 So - o - o, I - - - - - - should have realized a lot of things before,
.            C                 G7      Am
 If this is love you've gotta give me more,
.         F              G7            C   G7 C G7
 Give me more, hey, hey, hey, give me more.
