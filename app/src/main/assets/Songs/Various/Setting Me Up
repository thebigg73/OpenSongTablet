.A
 You say I'm the greatest bound for glory
.                                  E D
 Well the word is out and I learned  
.A
 I got the latest side of the story
.        G          D              A
 You're pulling out before you get burned

 Well your hands are squeezing me down to the bone
 I never saw you breaking no law
 Stands to reason I've got to leave you alone
 What you take me for

.        A                      D
 You're setting me up to put me down
.        E                        A
 You're making me out to be your clown
.           A                        D
 You're just setting me up to put me down
.            E
 You better give it up
.                        A
 Quit your messing around

 You think I care about your reaction
 You think I don't understand
 All you wanted was a piece of the action
 Now you talk about another man</lyrics>
