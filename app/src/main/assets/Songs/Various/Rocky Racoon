;Spoken:
.Am7                                          D7
 Now somewhere in the Black Mountain hills of Dakota
.                                       G7
 there lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
 And one day his woman ran off with another guy
.C
 Hit young Rocky in the eye
.C/B
 Rocky didn't like that,
.Am7                            D7
 he said I'm gonna get that boy 
.        G7
 So one day he walked into town
.                      C               C/B
 and booked himself a room in a local saloon

;Sing:
.Am7                     D7
 Rocky Raccoon, checked into his room,
. G7                     C    C/B
 only to find Gideon's Bible. 
.Am7              D7
 Rocky had come, equipped with a gun,
.    G7                         C   C/B
 to shoot off the legs of his rival 
.      Am7                D7
 His rival it seems, had broken his dreams,
.    G7                         C  C/B
 by stealing the girl of his fancy 
.     Am7                      D7
 Her name was McGill, And she called herself Lil,
.     G7                   C    C/B
 but everyone knew her as Nancy 

 Now she and her man, who called himself Dan,
 were in the next room at the hoedown
 Rocky burst in and grinning a grin,
 he said "Danny boy, this is a showdown."
 But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot,
 and Rocky collapsed in the corner.

.Am7 D7 G7 C C/B
     
 (instrumental)

 Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin, and proceeded to lie on the table
 He said, "Rocky, you met your match,"
 but Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
 and I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able."

 Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room only to find Gideons Bible
 Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
 to help with good Rocky's revival.</lyrics>
