.G
 It's another tequila sunrise
.D                         Am D7          G
 Starin' slowly 'cross the sky,  said goodbye
.G
 He was just a hired hand
.D                                  Am D7             G
 Workin on the dreams he planned to try,  the days go by

.Em                   C
 Every night when the sun goes down
.Em           C             Em
 Just another lonely boy in town
.    Am                D7
 And she's out runnin' round

.G
 She wasn't just another woman
.D                               AmD7              G
 And I couldn't keep from comin' on,  it's been so long
.G
 Oh and it's a hollow feelin'
.D                             Am     D7          G
 When it comes down to dealin' friends,  it never ends

.Am           D
 Take another shot of courage
.Bm             E                 Am  B               Em7  A
 Wonder why the right words never come,  you just get numb 

.G
 It's another tequila sunrise
.D                              Am  D7         G
 This old world still looks the same,  another frame</lyrics>
