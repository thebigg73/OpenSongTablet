;Barenaked Ladies

.G           D                           C
 When I was born, they looked at me and said
 What a good boy, what a smart boy, what a strong boy
.G                  D                            C
 And when you were born, they looked at you and said
 What a good girl, what a smart girl, what a pretty girl

 We've got these chains that hang around our necks
 People want to strangle us with them before we take our first breath
 Afraid of change, afraid of staying the same
 When temptation calls, we just look away

;CHORUS:
.G                 D
 This name is the hairshirt I wear
.            C
 And this hairshirt is woven from your brown hair
.G                 D
 This song is the cross that I bear
.        C
 Bear with me, Bear with me, Bear with me
.                  G D C(open) C
 Be with me tonight
.                        G D C(open) C
 I know that it isn't right
 But be with me tonight

 I go to school, I write exams
 If I pass, If I fail, If I drop out, does anyone give a damn?
 And if they do, they'll soon forget
 'Cause it won't take much for me to show that my life ain't over yet

 I wake up scared, I wake up strange
 I wake up wondering if anything in my life is ever gonna change
 I wake up scared, I wake up strange
 And everything around me stays the same

;CHORUS

 I couldn't tell you, that I was wrong
 Chickened out, grabbed a pen and paper, sat down and I wrote this song
 I couldn't tell you, you were right
 So instead I looked in the mirror, watched TV, laid awake all night

 We've got these chains that hang around our necks
 People want to strangle us with them before we take our first breath
 Afraid of change, afraid of staying the same
 When temptation calls . . .

;CHORUS
