;intro
.Em

.Em                            D
 Creeping up the blind side, shinning up the wall
.D                          Em
 stealing thru the dark of night
.Em                        D
 Climbing thru a window, stepping to the floor
.D                            Em
 checking to the left and the right
.Em                      D
 Picking up the pieces, putting them away
.D                             C         Am
 something doesn't feel quite right      

;chorus
[C]
.Em                  C   Am     Em
 Help me someone, let me out of here
.      C         Am        D        Bm
 then out of the dark was suddenly heard
.C              Am          Em
 welcome to the Home by the Sea
[]

 Coming out the woodwork, thru the open door
 pushing from above and below
 shadows without substance, in the shape of men
 round and down and sideways they go
 adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
 then as one they sign and they moan

;chorus
 Help us someone, let us out of here
 living here so long undisturbed
 dreaming of the time we were free
 so many years ago
 before the time when we first heard
 welcome to the Home by the Sea

.Em  G        Bm   D
     Sit down Sit down
.   Em            G                Bm        D
 as we relive out lives in what we tell you  

;bridge
.Em AmEmCadd9 Em Gadd2 G F C Am Em Bm Em
                             

 Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
 things that go to make up a life
 endless days of summer longer nights of gloom
 waiting for the morning light
 scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame
 things that go to make up a life

;repeat long chorus

 Sit down Sit down
 as we relive out lives in what we tell you
 let us relive out lives in what we tell you
 Sit down sit down
.Em
 cos you won't get away
.G
 so with us you will stay
.Bm                             D
 for the rest of your days. So sit down
 As we relive out lives in what we tell you
 Let us relive out lives in what we tell you</lyrics>
