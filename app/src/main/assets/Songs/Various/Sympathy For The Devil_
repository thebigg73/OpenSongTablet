[Intro]  Bongos, drums, people going 'wooo' and 'yow', etc.

.        E                       D                  A                 E
[V]  Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
 I've been around for a long long year, stole many a man's soul and face
 I was round when Jesus Christ had his moments of doubt and pain
 Made damn' sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

.        B                                      E
[C] Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
.B                                           E
 But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[V]  Stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was the time for a change
 Killed the Tsar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
 I rode a tank in the general's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged,
 and the bodies stank

[C]

[V]  I watched with glee while your kings and queens fought for ten decades
 for the gods they made
 I shouted out 'who killed the Kennedys?' when after all,
 it was you and me
 Let me please introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
 And I lay traps for troubadours, who get killed before
 they reach Bombay

[C]

 Solo on verse riff:

[C]

[V]  Just as every cop is a criminal, and all the sinners saints
 This head, this tail, just call me Lucifer, 'cos I'm in need
 of some restraint
 So if you meet me have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste
 Use all your well-learned politics, or I'll lay your soul to waste

[C]

 Workout on verse riff, and fade:</lyrics>
