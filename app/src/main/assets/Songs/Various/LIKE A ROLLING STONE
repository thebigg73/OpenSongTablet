.G                     Am7
 Once upon a time, you dressed so fine,
.Em7                    C              D          D
 Threw the bums a dime, in your prime, didn't you?
.G                 Am7                  Em7
 People call, say "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall."
.    C                     D           D
 You thought they were all kiddin' you.
.C           D                   C                  D
 You used to laugh about         Everybody that was hangin' out,
.C           Em7   Am7     G     C       Em7   Am7     G
 But now you don't talk so loud, Now you don't seem so proud,
.Am                                      D    D
 About havin' to be scroungin' your next meal.
.D           G     C  D          D           G    C D
 How does it feel?               How does it feel.
.D           G     C  D          D             G    C  D
 To be on your own.              With no direction home.
.D             G    C  D         D             G    C D
 A complete unknown.             Like a rollin' stone.

 You've gone to the finest schools, alright, Miss Lovely,
 But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
 You never had to live out on the street,
 But now you're gonna have to get used to it.
 You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
 Who carried on his shoulders a Siamese cat.
 Ain't it hard when you discover that
 He really wasn't where it's at
 After he took from you everything he could steal.

 You never turned around to see the frowns
 On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
 Never understood that it ain't no good.
 You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
 You said you'd never compromise
 With the Mystery Tramp but now you realize
 He's not selling any alibis
 As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
 And he says, "Do you want to make a deal?"

 Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
 They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they've got it made.
 Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts,
 You'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe.
 You used to be so amused
 At Napolean in rags and the language that he used
 Go to him now he calls you you can't refuse
 When you got nothin' you got nothin' to lose
 Your invisible now you've got no secrets to conceal.
