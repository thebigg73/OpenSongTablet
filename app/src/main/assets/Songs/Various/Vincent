.              G                         Am
 Starry starry night, paint your palette blue and grey
.              C                 D7                                G
 Look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
.               G                               Am
 Shadows on the hills, sketch the trees and the daffodills
.                          C                 D7                        G      C G
 Catch the breeeze and the winter chills, in colors on the snowy linen land     

[C
.           Am    D7                G
 Now I understand what you tried to say to me
.Em                       Am7   D7                         Em
 How you suffered for you sanity How you tried to set them free
.                               A7       Am7   D7                      G
 They would not listen they did not know how    Perhaps they'll listen now
[

.              G                           Am
 Starry starry night, flaming flowers that brightly blaze
.                   C           D7                                 G
 Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of chine blue
.                G                            Am
 Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grain
.                C                 D7                                  G      C G
 Weathered faces lined in pain are soothed 'neath the artists's loving hand     

;chorus
.G                  Am7       D7                      G      F# E
 For they could not love you, but still your love was true      
.            Am7                             Cm
 And when no hope was left in sight, on that starry starry night
.    G                 F7           E7
 You took your life as lovers often do,
.      Am7
 But I could have told you, Vincent,
.     C                                D7
 This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

.              G                        Am
 Stary, starry night, portraits hung in empty halls
.                   C                   D7                                     G
 Frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
.                              G                      Am
 Like the stranger that you've met, the ragged man in ragged clothes
.                    C                D7                               G       C G
 The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow      

.        Am         D7                G
 Now I think I know what you tried to say to me
.Em                       Am7   D7                         Em
 How you suffered for you sanity How you tried to set them free
.                              A7            Am7     D7
 They would not listen they're not listening still   
.                   G
 Perhaps they never will</lyrics>
