;Barenaked Ladies

;Intro
.G             Am               Cm       G
 Enid we never really knew each other anyway
.G             Am               Cm       F
 Enid we never really knew each other anyway

.F            C                      G
 It took me a year to believe it was over
.F              C                    Bm         E
 It took me two more to get over the loss (whoa whoa)
.F        C                               G
 I took a beating when you wrote me those letters
.F         C                   D
 And every time I remember the taste of your lip gloss

;CHORUS (same as intro, but end every line on the G chord)

.F          C                      G
 There were times when I wanted to hurt you
.F              C                        Bm         E
 And there were times when I know that I did  (whoa whoa)
.F          C                            G
 There were times when I thought I would kill you
.F           C                     D
 But can you blame me I was only a kid

.Am          D            G      G/F#           Em
 Now tell me why we never really respected each other
.Am          D           G             G/F#       Em
 And tell me why I never believed that you were a person too
.Am       D                           G  G/F#Em
 I always thought that you fancied my brother
.Am             D               G   G/F#    Em
 I may not have liked it oh but memory is a strange thing oh and
.Am    D               G
 Enid, Enid I remember you

;CHORUS

;Repeat first verse

 Now it's not fair to say that it's 'cause I was 3 inches shorter then
 And it's not fair to say that it's 'cause I was only 15 years old
 But maybe it's fair to say there was a lack of communication
 I took the phone message oh and speaking of communication oh well
 Enid, Enid you caught a cold

.G                         Am
 I could get a job I could pay the phone bills
.        Cm                       G
 I could cut the lawn cut my hair cut out my cholesterol
.G                       Am
 I could work overtime I could work in a mine
.Cm
 I could do it all for you
.G
 BUT I DON'T WANT TO!!</lyrics>
