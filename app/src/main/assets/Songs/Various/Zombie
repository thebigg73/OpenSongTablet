;From Phil McManus UUJ (MUFC were robbed of 2 points on 17th
;of April 1995 by some pratt of a ref who missed a blatant handball
;in the Chelsea box)

;The Cranberries

 Another head hangs lowly
 Child is slowly taken
 And the violence caused such silence
 Who are we mistaken

 but you see, it's not me
 it's not my family
 in your head, in your head
 they are fighting

;Chorus

 With their tanks, and their bombs,
 and their bombs, and their guns
 In your head, in your head they are cryin'
 In your head, In your head
 Zombie, etc.
 What's in your head in your head, in your head
 Zombie, etc.

 Another mother's breakin'
 heart is taking over
 when the violence causes silence
 we must be mistaken
 it's the same old theme since 1916
 in your head,
 in your head they're still fightin'

;Chorus

;Chords are Fm, Db, G#, Gm, repeated over and over
;I only submitted this because it was requested and
;not because I like it.  Well I used to like it until
;some fat slapper (initials LH) moved into my brothers
;house armed with her one and only CD which this happened
;to be on.  This mutt played the hole clean out of this track
;therefore this is why I dislike it so much now.  Bitch.</lyrics>
