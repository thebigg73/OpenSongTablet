.G          C              G
 Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
.C           A7     Am7      D#dim     Em   G+
 Take these broken wings and learn to fly.  
.G    A9   C   Cm
 All your life,
.G G            A7               C     D9   G
 You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

.G          C              G
 Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
.C           A7    Am7      D#dim     Em   G+
 Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.  
.G    A9   C   Cm
 All your life,
.G              A7               C     D9     G
 You were only waiting for this moment to be free.

.F Em  Dm   C  Bb  C
 Black - bird, fly.
.F Em  Dm   C  Bb    A7
 Black - bird, fly...
.          Dm        Dm7          G  C   G  C  G
 Into the light of a dark, black night.
