 Don't bother me, leave me alone

 Anyway I'm almost grown

 I don't run around with no mob.
 Got myself a little job
 I'm gonna buy me a little car,
 Drive my girl in the park

;INSTRUMENTAL

 Got my eye on a little girl.
 Ah, she's really out of this world.
 When I take her to the dance,
 She's got to talk about romance.

;REFRAIN

;INSTRUMENTAL

 You know I'm still livin' in town.
 But I done married and settled down.
 Now I really have a ball
 So I don't browse around at all</lyrics>
