.     D         F#m    G         F#m
 I see trees of green, red roses too
.Em7        D     F#7         Bm
 I see them bloom, for me and you,
.      Bb              Em7/A   A7        D    D+   Gmaj7   A7
 And I think to myself, What a wonderful world.            

.     D         F#m      G         F#m
 I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
.Em7                D        F#7         Bm
 The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
.      Bb              Em7/A    A7        D   G   G   D
 And I think to myself, what a wonderful world        

.    A7                        D
 The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
.    A7                   D
 Are also on the faces of people goin' by
.      Bm              F#m             Bm         F#m
 I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
.Em7            F#dim7   Em7  F#dim7  Em7
 They're really saying,  "I   love    you."

.A7     D      F#m    G          F#m
 I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
.Em7                D    F#7            Bm
 They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
.      Bb              Em7/A    A7        D   F#m7b5   B7
 And I think to myself what a wonderful world          

.      Em7             Em7/A   A7b9      D    G6  D
 Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.</lyrics>
