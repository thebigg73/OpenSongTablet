  <lyrics>[V1]
.A      D        E          A       A        D     E       A 
 In His plan God has placed people, to stand up at certain times;
.A      D           E        F#m F#m/E D           A/E     E       A 
 He has called such ordinary people    who feel as weak as you and I.
 
[V2]
 Esther stood up for her people: trusted Him in facing death.
 God did honour Esther's trust, and asks us now to stand for Him.

[C]
.        A                       E
 We were born for such a time as this;
.             F#m       F#m/E    D
 To speak the truth and save our nation.
.         A/E                    E
 With the lord, let's spread the word,
.       D                   A
 Let us stand and claim our land.

[V3]
 When Columba faced the pagans, trying to stop your praises sung.
 Raised His voice to sound like thunder, causing them to turn away and run.

[V4]
 Many other men and women|found it hard to heed His call;
 But they knew that God would never leave them,|now our nation needs us all

[B]
.         A                   D
 When the Lord calls upon His people
.    A                   E
 To arise and testify to Him,
.        A              F#m     F#m/E D
 We must look to Him to receive our   power,
.        A           E                A
 And our strength in weakness He will bring

[V5]
 Send revival to our nation, cause our hearts to beat once more
 And our lips to sing Your praises and our ears to hear the Lion's roar
