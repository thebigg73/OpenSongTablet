.D        D7      G      D
 Twinkle, twinkle little star
.G     D      A7       D
 How I wonder what you are
.D   G        D        A
 Up above the world so high
.D      G       D      A
 Like a diamond in the sky.
.D        D7      G      D
 Twinkle, twinkle little star
.G     D      A7       D
 How I wonder what you are.

[V2]
 In a manger full of hay,
 That’s where baby Jesus lay.
 Mary laid Him down to sleep,
 In a food box meant for sheep.
 In a manger full of hay,
 That’s where baby Jesus lay.

[V3]
 Shepherds in the field at night,
 Saw a very wondrous sight.
 Angels came from heaven above,
 Told the shepherds of God’s love
 Baby Jesus born that day,
 Sleeping on a bed of hay.

[V4]
 Wise men watching stars at night
 Saw a new star shining bright
 Followed it to find a king
 Precious gifts for Him they bring
 Bowing low they worship Him,
 Baby Jesus, King of kings!</lyrics></song>
